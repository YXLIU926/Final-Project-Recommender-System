# Hotel Recommender System

A hotel recommendation system that will make use of cosine similarity to output similar recommendations in New York based on selected features from a Seattle's hotel.

Check out the demo streamlit app https://share.streamlit.io/yxliu926/similar-hotel-recommender-system/main/app_demo.py!

To accommodate Streamlit's limited resources, the demo version only includes five hotels from Seattle and thirty from New York.
