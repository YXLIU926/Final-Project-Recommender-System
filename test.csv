123037,Georgetown Inn,2.0,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60878-d123037-Reviews-Georgetown_Inn-Seattle_Washington.html,,WA,6100 Corson Avenue South,98109,Seattle,4.269230769230769,4.461538461538462,3.628205128205128,3.576923076923077,3.8205128205128207,"The Georgetown Inn of Seattle is very clean, safe, and perfectly located for my occasional visits to Seattle. The best part of the stay, though, was the staff, each of whom welcomed me warmly, looked after my incidental needs with a smile, and brewed terrific coffee. The maid service was excellent and the maid came to clean my room also with a very warm smile. Overall, a very good value and a very pleasant place to stay..Nothing special about this hotel. It looks like a Super 8 that was privately purchased. It was clean and a place to sleep but nothing else. The toiletries were very cheap (I don't expect much from a hotel, but these were worse than most) and there was no blow dryer in the room. There was also a large gouge out of the toilet seat which looked tacky, cheap and unclean. The air conditioner/heater did not have a thermostat, only an on/off, so it was very hard to control the temperature in the room. It also smelled slightly musty. The area itself has a few restaurants and bars within a few blocks, but overall, not an area in Seattle I would consider visiting again...my boyfriend and I frequent Seattle so we stayed here to check out the Georgetown area. It is a pretty run down area, but we did walk to a nice pizza place that was about 3 blocks away and also encountered a couple of ok bars.I had some friends and family in from out of town for a Seahawks game recently and I couldn't find a decent place to stay for the life of me until I happened upon the Georgetown Inn. Everything else was either booked up, a complete dump, or along the lines of hotel 1000, the W etc (really expensive)
This place was clean, the prices are great, the people go out of their way to accomidate you, it's close enough to down town, and the rooms are really comfortable. If you are looking for something reasonably priced and you should absolutely check these guys out.Booked this hotel because of the good trip advisor reviews...which i dont totally agree with. My room faced out towards the very noisy street. Spacious king room but no frills. Front desk person nice, breakfast very average and area a bit sketchy. Super noisy bathroom fan.We stayed at the Georgetown Inn for two nights in September. Rooms were clean ànd comfortable and the service was friendly. Overall very good value! The location is handy right off of the I5 and only a 10 minute or so drive into the city. If you prefer avoiding the interstate you can go straight down 4th which takes you right by the stadiums and their is also bus service close by. There are several restaurants and pubs within easy walking distance - especially on the main strip (Airport Way). A 24 hour diner - the square knot - was surprisingly good.I would agree with the other reviewers that there's nothing to keep you away from the Georgetown inn. I think it is the cheapest hotel in the area. The only other one is 'the Grove' (see my other review) and it only costs a bit more, but it is closer in. The only problem I had was getting to the inn which is located at the end of Michigan street. I was heading east and failed to turn left to get to the hotel and ended up south bound on I5 for a couple of minutes before I could turn around. And if you love Harbor Freight Tools, they got one just across the street!Busy area, but we had a wonderful Stay. The rooms are very well insulated from the noise of the street. They allowed us to check in early, very helpful & friendly clerks. The rooms are clean and have a mini fridge. The Breakfast Bar was perfect.The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was slightly small but very clean, and had a mini fridge. I like that provided was free of charge, unlike some other Seattle hotels. There's a lot of industrial-type buildings in surrounding neighborhoods but the immediate area was historical and eclectic if you venture around the blocks: a record and comic book store, a specialty beer shop, and a funny ""trailer park mall"". Easy access to I-5. Overall, I would stay there again.We have stayed here 2 nights and have been contented with this hotel. Its simple, but clean. Breakfast is ok. Only one point of criticism: our rooms have been very noisy due to a great avenue directly near the hotel where lots of trucks are driving even during the night.Clean, comfortable, good bed, uninspiring breakfast. Don't stay here unless you have your own transport - two trips to town ($15-20 per trip) and you've paid for a more upmarket hotel. We stayed Saturday night & unfortunately the village idiots raced cars and motorcycles up the road outside our room on a couple of occasions!We had the wonderful fortune of all the downtown hotels in Seattle being booked. We wondered if the wonderful reviews of this little hotel could be true, and after reading: extremely clean, gracious staff, WONDERFUL BEDS, free parking, continental breakfast, we decided to give it a try. What a wonderful treat. This modest gem is in an industrial neighborhood with a charming renovated little old town area full of diverse bars, and restaurants. It was a safe and pleasant 1 to 2 block walk to dinner and drinks. The buses to downtown Seattle also stop in this area so it is easy to leave your vehicle and avoiding the parking headaches of downtown. Our room was spacious, quiet, had a jacuzzi tub, refrigerator, free internet,and a wonderful bed. There is a work out room,& laundry facility on the property. The continental breakfast was fruit, cereal, Costco muffins, English muffins, oatmeal, juice,coffee, and tea. Possibly the most remarkable aspect of the hotel is the staff. We were so impressed that we booked the 2nd leg of our return trip from Canada at this wonderful hotel.Two friends and I were doing a Sprint Triathlon at Genesee Park on Lake Washington. We wanted a clean, close by, reasonably priced place to spend the night before the race, and the Georgetown Inn was all that. It was only a few miles from the park, so we were able to sleep a bit longer that morning without having to worry about fighting traffic. The room was kind of small, but nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. Additionally, the hotel was remarkably quiet. They had a small but adequate continental breakfast, which included fresh fruit, assorted Costco muffins (waaayyy better than those little prepackaged ones which were baked who knows how long ago), cereals (including hot), english muffins, and coffee/tea. Just right for us, and definitely better than what some of the major chain hotels offer. The Georgetown Inn is located near Boeing Field in an older neighborhood, but easy enough to find with a Garmin or other navigation system. We got settled in early and got a good night's sleep; which was what we wanted anyway. It's not fancy, but it's clean, comfortable, and the staff were very nice. I recommend the Georgetown Inn to anyone who wants a clean, simple, affordable place to sleep.During our recent visit to Seattle, we were looking for a place near downtown but not in downtown. The Georgetown Inn is perfect and very affordable and safe. We were impressed from the moment we walked in the door with the inviting atmosphere and the welcoming staff. Our room was spacious and extremely clean with everything one would need including free internet, refrigerator, etc. Another plus, was free parking and breakfast. The management, recommended several good choices for dinner that are withing walking distance. In fact, Richard actually walked with us to the restaurant we chose, a wonderful little Italian bistro, and told the waitress there to take care of his friends, which they did very well. All of the staff here went to every effort to make our stay here a pleasant one. The hotel is in what would be called the industrial area of town. Actually, this area is undertaking a major revitalization program with many upscale restaurants, condos, etc. We would definitely recommend the Georgetown Inn for anyone traveling in this area.Extremely clean, comfy, with free parking and breakfast. A good value in a pricey city. Yes, it is in an industrial area which has a few bars and not much else you would want in the way of night life.
Tony was a big help as we needed to check out and did not get the shuttle for a couple of hours after check out. He secured our luggage until we returned. The staff, including the maid, was very pleasant and friendly. We highly recommend it for budget travelers who need a clean, nice, but reasonable place to stay. Also got a good snack at the Thai restaurant across the street.Stayed 2 nights with my 18 year old son while visiting Seattle. Had priced hotels downtown and just couldn't see paying that much & getting so little. Loved that there was free parking and breakfast. Not a bad area, not sure I would be out late at night but that is just me. Service was excellent and suggested a great restaurant we walked to for dinner our first night there. I think the worst thing about the hotel was that we kept getting lost on our way from downtown to the hotel each night, not their problem-ours! The room was spacious and very clean. Would definitely stay here if we ever get to Seattle again.I can't say enough good about this hotel. My wife and I were a little skeptical at first about the hotel because it's in an industrial area of Seattle and a little removed from downtown. But we loved our experience! Being in an industrial area made no difference to us because it is a clean, quiet area of town. The manager, Richard, and his staff were absolutely wonderful. We have a very active 15-month old boy. Instead of being irritated by his loudness while we were in the lobby, the staff was very friendly to him, often offering him a small snack. Richard was very helpful in making our stay comfortable and even helped us find a reliable mechanic when we had car trouble. The room rates are incredible for the level of service the Georgetown Inn offers. The rooms offered comfortable sleeping, and the breakfast was adequate. We will definitely be returning to this hotel the next time we're in Seattle.Recently stayed for nine nights and we were very pleased with this small hotel in the Georgetown section of Seattle. The room was clean and comfortable with all the amenities we needed. Parking was free and the free continental breakfast was very good. Most importantly, the rates were very reasonable. Oh, the staff was friendly and helpful especially Rick who made us feel welcomed. Although the hotel is not located in the midst of downtown Seattle, at least it is away from the congestion of town. We highly recommend Georgetown Inn and we will definitely return.The Georgetown Inn was a very pleasant surprise for my wife and I. We originally were going to stay in a private home, but then due to unforeseen cicumstances we had to get a hotel. I was more than pleased with the room and the continental breakfast was excellent. What set this Inn apart from others like it was the area it was situated in. Georgetown is currently being ""reclaimed"" and it has a thriving art community. Great pubs, art galleries, record stores and restaurants are emerging in this area. There is a vitality in the air that is very cool to be around. I would definitely stay there again.We needed somewhere to crash in Seattle before catching a flight to Alaksa. Hotels downtown were crazy expensive, so I started checking out places a little further out. Liked the sound of the Georgetown Inn, and am really glad we picked it. 
It's a little hard to find, although with GPS it's not hard at all, and it's just a few miles from the main tourist areas downtown. There's free parking (another big advantage over downtown hotels)
Room was decent sized, and fairly quiet. Very clean. My only complaint was that the bed leaned slightly to one side, but it was so big that I just stayed closer to the other side and was fine. Thick blackout blinds, and working wifi. Breakfast was decent, a better continental spread than your average airport hotel, I'd say.
Once we were settled, we took the suggestion of the desk clerk and walked around the neighborhood. While it looked like purely industrial estates from the main street, only a block away and we ended up in a trendy little area. Several bars and restaurants, record shop, comic book store and even a 'trailer park mall', which was sadly closed by the time we arrived. The whole place had a cool vibe and I'll definitely check out Georgetown again when I'm in Seattle. 
I'd recommend this as a good value stay in Seattle, with the added advantage of discovering a hidden gem of a neighborhood as a bonus!The Georgetown offers a quality and comfortable stay at an affordable price, being situated just close enough to downtown Seattle. It is clear that the hotel has focused on improving it's rooms, where you will find immaculate bathrooms and fresh, comfortable beds. The friendly staff keeps me coming back as it truly feels like you are being housed by family. I have stayed at the Georgetown three times, and I will continue to do so with future trips to Seattle. Thank you Georgetown!I messed up our plans to stay downtown Seattle at the last minute and found this by accident, but am glad we did. Very clean, attentive staff, late night check in very helpful, morning coffee was ready when I was and the place was very well cared for in and out. Parking a bit tight, but would stay again if I was in the area.I stayed in the suit for my birthday. I am sure i was a bit of a handful :) the staff were amazingly sweet and helped in anyway they possibly could. Gave me a late check out and left a sweet note on my door. The Manager Rich was easy to get on with and very personable.
I would recommend staying here for any occasion.Courteous service from staff of all fronts. Neat room & beds. Great value & very affordable. Will not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends.From Rich (General Manager), to the front desk staff, to the maid staff, what a great hidden gem! The friendliest staff I have encountered in my many years of travel. Very clean, comfortable rooms with upgrades to include new beds and flat screen televisions. For the price, the value is second to none in the area. I stayed for four nights with no negative issues. I traveled alone on business and did not find the neighborhood intimidating at all.
I would highly recommend the Georgetown Inn. 
 Rich, thanks to you and your staff for a great stay!

WisconsinClean, reasonable accommodation in a rather interesting historic section of Seattle - industrial Georgetown now filled with cool shops, bars and restaurants. We just needed a place to sleep in the southern portion of Seattle and this was perfect. The room was small but comfortable, clean and well taken care of, flat-screen TV, mini-fridge, fluffy towels, nice duvet in white linen cover. Everything worked. Although the area is somewhat industrial, the presence of some funky shops, bars and restaurants made it quite inviting... and a good place for late night snacks. WE had no trouble finding the the Inn and it was actually a pretty central location for forays around the city. The continental breakfast featured fresh fruit and good muffins... I would have liked a coffee maker in the room but coffee and tea were available in the lobby round the clock, so it wasn't a huge problem. The staff was friendly and professional. All in all a good stay.although nothing can change the neighborhood { nite time } , what a wonderful difference in the beds ...so so so comfortable , Georgetown has always been very clean , things have been wonderfully stepped up , new fresh towels , nice clean duvets { I love this idea } beautiful choices in decor of common areas , Great guest service , we have been staying at Georgetown for 5 years , for our trips to VA { very close and easy to get to } and always ask to stay here because of convince , and although back then beds were bad { hard } and neighborhood questionable , the staff ran a tight ship and still do never a problem with parking lot /car Great Job Wonderful Front Desk , Housekeeping Staff , Thank You so much for giving us a comfortable place to stay , during a difficult timeI've been staying there on and off for the last year and the rooms are nice, clean, beds are very comfortable, and there's a mini refrigerator in every room.
Flat screen TV's in every room and the staff are the nicest you'll find around.
Located literally feet from the freeway. They also have the parking lot covered by video surveillance.
I highly recommend Georgetown Inn to anyone looking for an affordable, clean, and safe experience.I was totally satisfied with the Georgetown Inn, as I needed a clean, affordable and functional place to stay that was convenient to I-5 and points just south of Seattle. While its location is very industrial, desolate and not family-friendly, it's great for an urban creative professional on a budget who wants to walk around the corner for relatively unpretentious bars (9lb Hammer) good bar eats (Smarty Pants) and a good coffee shop hangout with WiFi (All City Coffee). Leave your kids at home, bring a camera and a car, and smile knowing you're getting a good value while supporting an independent establishment without breaking the bank.We stayed at the Georgetown Inn Feb.. 25 th after attending the Boeing Flight Museum's Hops and Props Party!! What a great, clean, and convenient place to stay while attending this function, I will highly recommend to my associates that they stay there as well next year when the Hops and Props return. Rich was very attentive to myself and all four of my friends. We will be staying up there soon as we are planning another function in Seattle. Thanks RIch for the great time!! DianneWe arrived at this little ""gem"" of a hotel on Friday night a couple of weeks ago and actually extended our stay for another night - not only to enjoy the city, but enjoy our comfy digs and rest a bit more. From the excellent staff (Tony, Richard, etc) at the front desk, to the highly recommended ""The Hangar Cafe""! The rooms are clean, the coffee hot, the linens crisp and the beds very comfortable. We actually enjoyed a kitchenette room, perfect for us, because we brought back leftovers for a midnight snack! For the location, I couldn't imagine even staying in some of the pricier hotels in downtown Seattle with this little secret find! We look forward to coming back again soon, and will recommend this hotel to our friends!I have stayed at the Georgetown several times over the past several years because of it's convenient location but was overwhelmed with the difference in service and atmosphere since it has been under new management. It began with having the option to make my own reservation online. I sent off a quick email asking about an early check in and was responded to within minutes with a ""come on in."" The staff at the front desk made checkin and checkout a breeze. Anthony ""Tony"" was phenomenal. He was professional and friendly and extremely helpful. They certainly have an excellent representative for their motel with him at the front desk. There is no doubt I will be staying again and would highly recommend this ""hidden gem"" to anyone. JamesThis is a great hotel in a perfect location in Seattle, right near the freeway. Richard at the front desk was very helpful, the service was perfect, and the hotel was very clean, and the free breakfast was incredible. Walking distance to many restaurants and bars. Highly recommended.When we checked in we were greeted by a young man named Tony. He was so pleasant & most helpful. Our room was as what we saw on the website, very clean, & we never had any complaints except the heater never shut off. The continental breakfast was good, fresh fruit every morning.I enjoyed my two day stay. The staff is friendly, rooms are immaculate, free breakfast is good. I would have given this hotel five stars but the location is in a rough area and it not not safe to go on foot after dark.This is my second stay at the Georgetown Inn, Suffice to say I enjoyed it very much. The Front desk personnel were kind, considerate and knowledgeable about the surrounding area. The rooms were clean and the interior decor has been recently updated. Overall a great hotel for the value.Excellent value for the money. The premises are exceptionally well cared for, regularly updated and very clean. Extremely polite and helpful staff.This is one of Seattle's best kept secret's. The Georgetown Inn has an easy to find location, right off exit 161 from I-5. The Staff are the secret ingredient, from Management to Housekeeping. They are all incredibly friendly and always helpful, and the Housekeeping Dept keeps the Inn immaculately clean. The rooms are cozy and incredibly quiet, obviously the builder paid attention to details when it came to room insulation. The rates are very affordable. I have stayed at the Inn numerous times over the last year on buisness & pleasure trips to the Seattle area and simply refuse to stay anywhere else. If you enjoy the simple and humble in hotels, and restful nights sleep, this is definitely THE PLACE to stay in Seattle!!Tony and everybody at the Seattle Georgetown Inn were so helpful! The atmosphere was very friendly. I enjoyed a comfortable stay, and look forward to my next visit when I'm in Seattle.This hotel has all the bases covered when it comes to the basics like clean, comfortable and great staff which makes it an enjoyable place to stay when I'm in town. What really sets the hotel apart though is the great neighborhood it's located in. Georgetown hasn't gotten the attention of Seattle's trendier neighborhoods - and that's a good thing. There are some great cafe's and a range of restaurants from the quirky, like Smarty Pants and Calamity Jane's, to the uber sophisticated Corson Building restaurant (reservations recommended). In the summer time there's a great outdoor market that's housed in a series of Airstream trailer's that's as fun as it is funky. There are a number of music venues in the area as well as some great taverns and breweries. Many people stay here because it's a great deal (which it certainly is) and because it's close to downtown Seattle, but do yourself a favor next time your in town and make it a point to explore the cornucopia of experiences that Georgetown has to offer - and all within walking distance of the Georgetown Inn.We have stayed at Georgetown in 3 times in January due to medical appointments in Seattle. We have consistantly gotten great friendly helpful service everytime. The rooms and hotel as a whole were clean and attractive.Due to a project in the area I have been staying at the Georgetown Inn for several weeks. The rooms are CLEAN and COMFORTABLE. The staff is friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to make your stay pleasant. Rich, the Manager, will make sure you enjoy your stay at the Georgetown Inn. 
Daryl K. ""DK""On jan 20th i stayed here and I was blown away by the customer service I got. This inn was is a great area easy to get to, also hot fresh coffee the whole time. The front desk person I belive his name was Kay, but not sure he was great he helped me and my wife get checked in and got us up to our room with ease. Also this was our frist time in seattle and didn't really know anything about the area so we asked kay where good places to eat and see, he told us of all kinds of places and we went to a couple and had a great time. normaly i don't write reveiws about places but with the mix of the hotel and the custmer service we i felt like i had to!!Georgetown Inn was our best hotel experience ever. The rooms and building are very clean, inviting and well maintained. The staff is very courteous and friendly. The manager was very personable and went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our stay. We will definitely be back.The next time someone needs a place to stay in Seattle, we'll suggest one place: the Georgetown Inn.
I got a job unexpectedly in Seattle, and my family and I needed a place to stay while I started work, we looked for an apartment, and we learned our way around a new city. The Georgetown Inn was the hotel that was closest to my work and was the most affordable place with a kitchenette, so we took a shot. Man are we happy we did.
The staff was top notch. Every one that worked there was extremely friendly, accommodating, and considerate. One of our first nights there, we spent about 20 minutes talking with Richard and Tony, and they gave us a wonderful overview of the neighborhood, restaurants, and places to go with our three year old. They pointed us to the park across the street where our son loved playing; to Via Tribunali (amazing pizza); and to other restaurants, shops, and places of interest. It was great. Plus, we loved that Richard knew local business owners by name. The fact that he was so invested in the neighborhood was truly attractive to us, and made our stay so much more fun. Compared to the hotels where we stayed on our drive out (""Um, there's an Arby's by the interstate"") we were so happy and felt that we got to know a wonderful neighborhood that we've already gone back to a couple times just to hang out.
The facility itself is nice. We don't stay in hotels much, so we don't have much in the way of expectations, but the Georgetown Inn was great. It was super clean, well decorated, and in a constant state of updates. During the two weeks we were there, there were minor (but not all all inconvenient) updates to the lobby which we thought looked pretty good to begin with. Also, furniture from various rooms was being updated, and it looked like beds were being changed out as well. Also, there were more amenities than we could have asked for: free laundry, sauna, exercise room, continental breakfast (Costco Muffins, bagels, toast, cereal, juice--way more than our usual bowl of cereal at home, so we were quite happy). Also, they had great coffee in the lobby 24 hours a day.
The cherry on the cake of our visit was this: A few days into our stay, and after talking with Richard and Tony, I got a call at work. We were offered the opportunity to move to the suite (at no additional cost) because Richard felt that it would be easier for my family and I since we were there for such a long time. It's the first time we've been offered an upgrade of any kind, and it was so worth the wait. The suite we moved to was great for us: it had a great kitchen, a large bath, and separate bedroom so I could work in the room after our son went to bed.
We can't recommend the Georgetown highly enough. We needed a clean, safe, functional hotel, and we got all that as well as a wonderful staff and an introduction to a wonderful neighborhood that is supporting local artisans/businesses. Great great great.My wife and I traveled to Seattle the first of December and stayed at this property based on a recommendation from a local small business owner. We extremely please with the comfort of the rooms and their cleanliness. At first we were not sure what to expect because the rates were so unbelievably reasonable. The beds were very comfortable and the staff friendly. Richard the General Manager introduced himself to guests during continental breakfast and seemed genuinely interested in our lodging experience. We will definitely return to this property on our next visit.I enjoyed my stay at this Hotel very much! The Staff was fanastic, the room spotless and very comfortable. The bed was great...I slept like a baby! Thanks to ANTHONY at the front desk for being so gracious! I am returning to this Hotel again later this week. I highly recommend the Georgetown Inn!!!-rooms were clean, until about 20 minutes after we showed up. 
-staff was very friendly to a drunk friend who decided to lay on the lobby floor while i went and got my slippers. 
-The only ""good"" food was across the street at our local shell station with bomb @$$ chicken, and the ""freshest"" food in town... which had been apparently sitting for hours. Nothing else was open and or would not deliver to us, sadly! 
-Complimentary breakfast included bomb sunny delight, minimal cereal selections, and toast with no jelly.
-Beds were reasonably comfortable, until you stick the biggest one in the group in the middle! But even then you cant complain. 
-Jacuzzi bathtub was nice to look at, but not used. (located across from the bed, NOT even in the bathroom doesn't leave much for privacy)
I will DEFINITELY be staying here next time!!!!clean , staff is hit or miss some very friendly , some more stren but given the ruff area nite staff have probaly seen thier share, wouldnt go out side early am or nite , stayed here many ,many ,many times thanks to VA vists , agin clean , uncomfortable beds ( leave as sore as if slept in car) we bring a feather bed and pillows last vist kinda helped, but clean ,close to VA , but really nothing eles as far as dinning ( Arbys, and a noodle place ) but if you have to come to Seattle VA , its very close and a easy to get to we alway try to get food before we check in , we have tried other places but agin clean close and works for us ,would advise not bringing kids they would be very bored and unable to be outside ( REALLY RUFF AREA ) prostution , drugs , homeless , but we seem to come back , just lock your car and get what you need before you come , wouldnt go on a walkNot too far from downtown Seattle, great place to stay over night. Showers were hot and the water pressure was reall high. Check out by 11 and head back to Seattle for our weekend trip. I would definitely stay here again.If you need to stay around boeing Field in Seattle you could do a lot worse. This Inn provides a continental breakfast and is located in the Georgetown area of Seattle.Ll rooms are second floor or above with the lobby on the main floor. I stayed on the third floor and the wifi was week but present. Not a lot of restaurants in the area so plan on driving. There is a Shell station across the street were you can by beer, fried chicken or the occasional jojo. The room was clean but dated. There was a refrigerator in the room. The room had a nice tv and was well lit. If I needed to be located in this area again I would stay here again. Thanks for reading.on my most recent trip to Seattle, my friend that lives there made me reservations because it was near to her house and gave a good AAA discount. After reading some of the reviews on here, I was a little leery, but I thought the worst thing that could happen is that we'd have to find a different hotel. I'm no stranger to Seattle so I'm pretty used to seeing the ""unseemly"" side of things. Granted, the area isn't great, but the hotel was very clean, very well kept, and the staff was very helpful and friendly.
I wish that they would have taken advantage of the second sink in the room and made it like a little ""coffee bar"" with a coffee machine and accessories, I know they have coffee down in the lobby, but I didn't really want to make the trek for coffee in my pajamas. 
 Also, my friend's hair dryer seemed to cause a little power outage in our room. The staff was very helpful in fixing it fast, but I think they might want to look into that issue as it was a standard hair dryer and we didn't have anything else plugged in the second time it happened. Hotel does provide hair dryers in the room, however they're small and kind of worthless when you have long thick hair. If I'm in need of a hotel in Seattle again, I would definately come back.I got a room here with my mother while she wound up staying at the nearby VA hospital for a last minute emergency. They set us up here because of the shuttle service that goes to and from the hospital.
Pros: the rooms were clean, and through my mother's coverage, the stay was free. That's about it. 
Cons: there is literally nothing of interest and nowhere to go nearby. Not even a simple supermarket.
There's a couple of restaurants across the street that had decent food and prices, and a gas station with the usual ridiculously overpriced groceries. However, a lot of rowdy people loitered in its parking lot at all hours of the night, and shouted a lot. I wouldn't recommend wandering around at night, as the neighborhood looks a bit unsafe. There was also a starbucks. From what I gather, there's ALWAYS a starbucks nearby in this city.
Technically they have wifi, but their signal strength is so weak you have to go down to the lobby to guarantee you won't get cut off unexpectedly. The rooms however are all upstairs.
I informed the man at the desk, and he just said ""yeah. I guess it's kinda weak. Depends on the device"". Well it wasn't just my device, cause I heard him say the same thing to several other guests that I heard complain while I was in the lobby trying to get a signal.
Also, there were several large and nasty looking spiders I had to squish, in our room , the lobby, and the laundry room. Gross. 
In the long run I guess I can't complain much, since I didn't pay a dime, but after staying a few days, I kind of wish I had splurged on something nicer.
If I WERE paying, I certainly wouldn't pay to stay here again.My children recently bought a house in the evolving hipster south Seattle area -- and Seattle is hard/expensive to book in the summer . We took a gamble on the Georgetown Inn - and admittedly it looks a little shakey from the outside. What a great surprise. It was very clean, super friendly and convenient to all the places we needed to be -- and parking is free. The service is great , its close to the airport and the place is well-run. The Georgetown area is 'transitional' - but fast becoming the hip, artsy center of Seattle -- take that Capitol Hill! 
We'll be backWe needed a place for my elderly father-in-law to stay for a week or so while visiting with his wife (in Mount St. Vincent nursing home). There are precious few places in West Seattle and we were getting kind of desparate. I drive by the Georgeton Inn regularly but, frankly, it didn't occur to me that this might be an option for him. It turned out to be great for him. The location is not picturesque (industrial area, by the freeway), but the location is actually very convenient for getting in and out of West Seattle. The facility was definitely safe -- all interior rooms, one point of entrance and exit, front-desk staff paying attention to who is coming and going. The rooms were spotless and comfy, although by no means plush. The price was excellent. Most important, every staff person we encountered was courteous, attentive, and pleasant. They went out of their way to help my father-in-law feel comfortable. The general manager, Richard, was super kind and welcoming and took obvious pride in his facility.We stay at the Georgetown every year for the gift show. This isn't a fancy place, but it is well kept up, clean and has nice appointments. It is just off the freeway on the south side of Seattle. If you have a reason to visit in the area, it's a great place to stay.We had a surgery at the VA Hospital and this was the lodging we received. It was very clean and has been updated with flat screen TV's and each room has a small refrigerator, There is a microwave in the lobby for use any time and a decent continental breakfast.The staff is very friendly , polite, and helpful. The security is very good because of the area,I did see a regular police patrol all the time. There is a shell station mini mart across the street and they say a few places to eat but we didn't venture out.There are a few small things if your very picky , the shuttle to the hospital doesn't start until 630 and we needed to be there by 6,and breakfast doesn't start until 6 so we missed out on that, It is a 5 minute drive to the hospital.They only have one ice machine on the second floor so you have to hoof it for ice or the elevator if your on a different floor.It is in the flight path for Boeing and the planes are very low and noisy and there is a distant train you here on a regular basis but all in all not to bad.I was very pleasantly surprised by the staff, and the excellent service at the Georgetown Inn. After reading all the negative reviews I had my doubts about staying here. When I arrived I was registered quickly and politely. The room was very clean and had a fresh scent. The room was basic but adequate with only a referigerator and TV. I worked in the hotel business many years ago, so I know what good service and care is. 
The bathroom was immaculate and the towels fresh as well. During my stay of 5 days the maid service was excellent and the front desk staff was polite, friendly and helpful. The free breakfast was satisfactory with a good variety of foods to choose from. The coffee was very good, and certainly kept fresh and plentiful.
The only concerns were the sound level from the airline traffic above and the firmness of the bed. The Inn is on the final flight approach to both Boeing Field and SeaTac Airport, so the sound of jet and airplane traffic was constant. I was on the upper 3rd floor so I was closest to the sound as well. The windows were insulated enough that I didn't find the noise levels too bothersome. I would think the first or second floors would be much quieter. The matress was extremely firm, almost board like. The pillows were soft, but fluffy. I prefer a firm bed so it wasn't too uncomfortable for me. I recommend taking your own pillows with you if you can.
The Inn provides a large flat screen TV, so viewing is very pleasent.
Wi-Fi is available in most rooms. My room had a poor Wi-Fi connection, so the Inn provided a long network cable with a direct internet connection for free. The network speeds were at all times excellent.
Easy access to the VA Hospital only 10 minutes away, or $8.00 by taxi. Easy on/off access to I-5 as well.The staff at this hotel are all outstanding, compassionate people who care about their hotel and the people who stay there. The front desk staff are all polite and accommodating, while the management is efficient and reasonable. The hotel is not in the nicest part of Seattle but that is no fault of its own--and the people who run the hotel absolutely make the most of what they have to work with. The cleaning staff are top-notch, which is reflected by the cleanliness of the rooms. 
The only minor flaw that I experienced was the slow internet service. Other than that, though, no complaints. This is a basic (not luxury) hotel but it comes with an extremely helpful staff, which makes a world of difference. For price and value, this hotel is very good. The people working here deserve respect and the hotel deserves a solid rating.Recently we have spent several days in the Georgetown Inn which is situated close to the VA hospital and convenient to downtown Seattle. Before going there we read reviews on this hotel, many of which were horrendous, so it was with some trepidation that we went to spend our first night there.
To our surprise we found the place extremely clean, rooms large and well furnished, breakfast is entirely adequate, coffee and tea are available round the clock, and the staff are kindly and helpful. While it is a no frill hotel, there is an exercise room, a sauna, and laundry facilities, all free of charge to people staying there.The VA put my husband and I in this hotel for five days after hubby's surgery. The Pros: lovely friendly helpful staff; clean clean rooms; decent complimentry breakfast; free coffee 24/7; free parking; 3 asian restaurants, 1 hamburger joint, one organic soup/salad cafe and a Starbucks just across the road; gas station across the road has little mini mart (and two great hot meal lunch specials every day); great shower pressure and plenty of hot water; free shuttle to VA and airport if needed; free laundry facilities; wifi worked great; small but sufficient gym and rooms were not too noisy once the air con was on; plus I could take a breakfast tray up to my husband every day. Cons: no coffee maker in the rooms; the bed was a little too hard for my liking.
 Now to address some of what the other reviews said. If you are there because of the VA, if your spouse/partner is just along for the drive then you WILL have to pay for them. I was there because my husband was not allowed to drive after the surgery. We did not see any hookers, but then we did not go out after dark. There were some homeless people around but I was never bothered walking to or from the gas station or restaurants. 
The staff are honest and conscientious and were super-dupa friendly no matter whether I wanted a bowl, extra sugar, more towels etc. No visitors after certain hours and they had to check in? Makes sense to me. The hotel is in an industrial area and there were some homeless people around. I can honestly say that if it were not for the dire circumstances we were there and if the beds were a little softer, it would have been a great stay. We will definitely stay there again, I will just bring a matress topper.I was sent to this motel by the VA. I am in Seattle for a doctor's appointment. I had NO choice but to stay as this location, or I would have NEVER stayed here. During check-in, I was told that my wife MUST come in (at the same time which meant our kids must come in too) and show her ID so that THEY COULD MAKE SURE SHE WASN'T ON THEIR LIST OF KNOWN HOOKERS!!!!! I asked to speak to a manager and was given a phone number that was disconnected. After check in we immediately received a call from the front desk that because the VA only had us staying one night that we must be out asap in the morning because ""they like to clean early"". I informed them that the VA was paying for 2 nights and that we would NOT be checking out in the morning. They then told us that their paperwork did not show a 2 night stay and that we were to check out and that if the VA DID authorize another night we could check back in at 4pm the next day. The VA called them and told them that ""yes they did authorize 2 nights and that the paperwork that they sent confirmed this"" but the motel is making us check out anyways and requiring us to bring back a NOTORIZED copy of the authorization from the VA. AFTER THE VA CALLED AN CONFIRMED THEIR AUTHORIZATION and FAXED them another copy of the original paperwork. They said ""You are just having a friend call and act like the VA"". I cannot believe the unprofessionalism and outright rudeness of the staff at this motel and would NOT EVER recommend anyone staying here. 
The website for this motel also states that there is a fitness center on site, but the staff only allows STAFF to use the fitness center. Also, there are only enough free parking spots for 1/4 of the number of rooms they have, THOUGH the website clearly states that they have AMPLE free parking for ALL rooms.I'm all for staying at a place that fits my budget and try to keep costs down for my company but this was ridiculous. Late flight arrival meant an unknown drive to what seemed like the middle of no where... Cab took off in a shot and I had to be buzzed in with an old fashioned buzzer door. (which took the man 3 times to finally let me in). It took 40 minutes to check in. It was already past midnight and I had meetings in the morning... He took my credit card and ID and didn't explain that he was just taking an imprint for security... so the next morning when I checked out, the girl asked for my card again and I argued with her until she finally explaned. (I pretty much thoughtI was being charged up front so I wouldn't leave in the middle of the night... given the feel of the place, )
Bed was hard, sheets were thin. No hairdryer (for fear of stealing I suppose). I know 2 other business people that were recommended this ""hotel"" for value but they weren't as dumb as me and jumped back in the cab to another hotel. 
If I were a student travelling with friends, this place would have been fine but I was solo in an unknow city so I definitely did not feel safe.Since we pass this hotel many times in our travels though Seattle we decided to give it a try.
Checking in was like trying to gain access to CIA central, both myself and my wife has to present our ID's. They would not complete the check-in until I verified my plate number.
We were quoted $79 a night, but on checking in, were informed that a second adult costs $15/night more.
The hotel is VERY clean and nicely appointed for the money, except the beds!
Ahhh, the beds, a sheet of plywood would be more comfortable! 
We had to ask for a blow dryer (hair dryer) at the front desk.
The rooms did have 37"" plasma TV w/Cable.
Microwave and refrigerators.
For a little effort, this would be a hidden gem, but alas, it is NOT!We stayed at The Georgetown Inn and hated it. The staff was rude and not helpful. The bed was bad and we couldn't sleep. It was like sleeping on a bed of rocks. When I complained about the bed the next morning, the clerk laughed and thought it was funny. I will never stay or recommend this place to anyone. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Days Inn or anywhere but The Georgetown Inn.We booked in here as we needed a one night stay in Seattle while going to a Safeco field. The location was good, the price was right, and the reviews seemed OK. The hotel was a bit odd (we hadn't been able to tell that from Trip Advisor) as there are really a full range of folks staying there (some seem to be living there while doing some hospital work or other long-term stuff). The staff were friendly, the room was clean, and there was a nice continental breakfast in the AM. There were signs outside about no spitting around the one outdoor lone bench that my kids found very odd. Also the hotel was in a neighborhood that seemed a bit on the edge. We would likely not stay there again.stayed for one night with my husband and daughter .room was spacious and clean staff were polite and helpful and the breakfast was lovelyThis is one of the worst places I have stayed. I was made to feel out of place and under constant scruteny. The only reason we kept staying there is the close proximety to the VA hospital. Our family spent over $10,000 at this place and still get a hard time to do any thing. The manager even had the nerve to call my room one night, after midnight, and wanted to come up to see if I was smoking. I was there with my daughter (11). And there for only one reason my dad at the hospital. And he was totally out of line. The ONLY thing going for this place is the shuttle, if it was not for this it would be the hookers.
If you do not need the shuttle service I would highly recomend a different motel.
 James HolmesHôtel conforme à nos attentes, les chambres sont spacieuses et propres. Le personnel est agérable et sympathique. 
Il est situé à 10 min à peine du centre ville de Seattle et de tout les centres d'intérêts. Vraiment parfait pour rayonner dans la ville.
Parking gratuit disponible.
Nous y retoutnerons sans hésiter, de plus les tarifs sont trés raisonnables pour un hôtel situé dans une grande ville (60 €/nuit...)The Georgetown Inn is not a fancy resort by any stetch, the doors use old-school metal keys and the decor is a bit dated. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the free parking and wi-fi were much appreciated, however. The free continental breakfast was more than adequate unless you're hoping for bacon and eggs. Best of all, access to and from Interstate 5 was a breeze.
The location is unfortunately industrial but there are a few fast food outlets nearby. The staff was very friendly. Our only complaint was a slow running drain in the bathroom sink.We stayed here because it was convenient to our friend's neighborhood and it was about the only hotel in the area. It's an up and coming area though still somewhat sketchy. The hotel doesn't look like much from the outside but the rooms are great and clean. There is parking that is well-monitored with cameras and fence and I felt secure here. But the rooms are the best reason to stay here. I love the duvet with covers (instead of horrible bedspreads that probably don't see the washer often), the comfortable mattress, flat screen tv. New paint, clean modern bath. Nicer than most hotels in this price range.This hotel is in the industrial area. Not too many restaurants open pass 7:00 pm. However, they offer excellent help and the room is clean and nice. It is only around 8 km away from Seattle down town. The continental breakfast is quite adequate for your start of the day.First let me say: If your in Seattle and this location suits you (about 5 minutes from downtown) I would stop searching and pull into the Georgetown Inn! This place was fabulous at half the cost of comparable locations. The manager is always working and always caring. I recently spent 2 nights here as part of a 30-day road trip, and this was the highlight of my trip. There was an awesome vegetarian restaurant/bar right around the corner and it was only minutes from downtown. All of the staff was friendly and the room was very clean and comfortable. We were upgraded to a studio room with a kitchenette and the manager took the time to personally check it out before we went in.
Just stop and stay and talk to the people at the desk! They will help you on your visit to Seattle.We stayed here a few nights ago (one night) and were satisfied. The hotel was fairly clean and the staff was very polite. We especially enjoyed the free parking, which is hard to find in Seattle. There is free Wi-Fi available-all you have to do is ask for the password. There was a mini-fridge in our room but I am not sure if this is a standard item in all of the rooms. The hotel is located within minutes of I-5.
There is a continental breakfast consisting of cereal, muffins and toast. Our recommendation (for the owner/manager) would be to make sure you have some type of a sugar-free substitute available for those who have certain dietary needs. One lady (in another group) asked for some and was told they did not have any. (The desk clerk was very apologetic about it.)I stayed here on business for three days and was pleasantly surprised how nice it was for the price. The staff is friendly respectful, and accommodating. The room was clean and well equipped with HBO and cable to serve my entertainment needs. The breakfast was enough to start the day. The local area offers unique restaurants for your dining needs. I would stay there again without hesitation.Free parking, free wifi and free breakfast! The location is just minutes from anything a tourist would want. Staff was great!I've stayed at the Georgetown Inn in Seattle about 4 times now, and each time, really enjoyed my stay. I used to stay at the Silver Cloud, but I much prefer the Georgetown - great hospitality, the manager is wonderful, and just as comfortable for almost half the price (free parking too!). My only complaint was that the mattress in one of the rooms I stayed in was too saggy for me, but ever since, I've always had a firm mattress. It may not be quite as fancy as some of the other hotels in the area, but what whatever it lacks in luxury, is easily made up for in service and price. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling on a budget and looking for some friendly faces!Stayed here and found out we were upgraded to a king suite for free. We stayed in room 312 on the corner of the building. It was a Friday night, super loud even with the air on, noisy, rude neighbors yelling in the hallway @ 2am, kids screaming. Will not stay here again for the $100 we paid for one night.My family was thrilled with our stay at the Georgetown Inn. I will say that they are not fancy, but what they do, they do right! Our suite was spotless, and included a full size fridge, stove, dishwasher and whirlpool tub. The Inn is in a comercial/industrial area right off the freeway, but we turned on the fan on the heating unit and had no problem sleeping. The price for the Seattle area is fantastic. They are within about 4 miles from the market area, Seattle University and about 6 miles from the space needle area. The staff was very helpful giving us directions and helping us when our car broke down. I would recommend this for everyone!"
123036,Hampton Inn & Suites Seattle Downtown,2.5,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60878-d123036-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Seattle_Downtown-Seattle_Washington.html,,WA,700 Fifth Ave. N,98109,Seattle,4.076124567474048,4.069204152249135,3.4844290657439445,2.688581314878893,3.57439446366782,"In terms of distance from the port to the hotels it won't cost you more than $ 20... LOL. The taxi guy was upset to get us as it was a close trip and not the airport one which he was expecting.
This hotel is close to the Space needle, You can actually walk to it... 
The breakfast is complimentary which is not all at great but then again it's free...
The rooms are ok, I would say livable.
There are a few restaurants around which can be used to dine in the evenings if you chose to.
There is also a bus stop if you chose to go to the Pike market place which would a great idea and it could take an entire day to explore it... 
Overall the hotel is reasonably priced and worth a short stay.Walking distance to the space needle and music museum. and tram downtown and far enough from downtown to be quiet. Well, there was a sports team of kids one night in our stay so the kids had to be called on twice to simmer down. Room was modern and facilities in good condition. The location is next to a full grocery store (QFC - so you can buy your water, fruits, toiletries, and other comforts that you were unable to take with your in your carry on), and multiple restaurants with in the area (sushi, pizza bar, Vietnamese, Thai, and new York deli.All Hamptons have a standard, which are good breakfast, clean rooms etc. and that is what is common to this hotel too. Although this Hampton is in downtown Seattle, just a block away from Space Needle that makes it great for visitors to Seattle it was not a big deal for me as I was on business trips - 3 trips each 3 nights long - and all I want to do at the end of the day is relax and crash.
On each trip I stayed in a suite, which has a separate living room with fireplace, and a bedroom. What actually made my trips a little unconfortable is inadequate heating in both living room and bedroom. I called the front desk to send someone to set the temperature correctly. He came and looked at the setting and said that that is ok and it would heat up. However, it never did. The temperature in the living room never climbed above 65 degrees, while the setting was for 72. In the bedroom I set the temperature to highest (its setting said - Most Confortable). However, it has such a tiny electric heating that the room stayed cold and my nose started to block in the night with cold. I in fact started to keep the bedroom door closed so that heat does not escape to hallway and bathroom. However, the cleaning staff opened to door next day and by the time I arrived in the evening from work, the room was cold again.
I wonder why do Hamptons in Seattle area are not that good compared to other cities where I have stayed, are really good. If I have to stay here again, I won't take the suite, and hopefully the regular rooms have better heating.My mom and I had a pleasant stay at this Hampton Inn & Suites over a weekend in November. It is a relatively close walk to the monorail and there are several bus routes towards the downtown/Pike Place Market area. There is a supermarket one block away in the new residential development, and many interesting dining choices nearby.
The hotel is on a hill, and houses separate “inn” and “suite” areas. In fact, the entire property has a maze-like feel with relatively dim hallways. However, the rooms are up to the usual high Hampton standards. The breakfast area is relatively large and recently renovated. 
Everyone was very friendly and professional. The cookies and fruit-infused water available in the lobby were delicious and refreshing. 
One thing we noticed is that there were several possibly itinerant people who stop by and use the lobby. The restrooms in the lobby require room key access. There was a man who made a recommendation for Citizen, a nearby coffee/beer/café place; it was a little unusual that he mentioned eating there several times a week. We also saw a disheveled woman in the lobby and later in the supermarket. However, it must be stressed that we did not feel unsafe at any time. 
Overall, this is a property that upholds all the great qualities for which Hampton Inns are known.I was pleasantly surprised when I stayed at the Hampton late November for the Marathon. The room I had booked was located next to the elevator, so I asked for a change, which was accommodated. I likely should have kept the initial room; the elevators were quiet and I ended up in part of the hotel which looked older (though in good repair and clean) and a farther walk from the entrance.
The hotel is about 350 metres from the Marathon start, close to the Space Needle and Monorail. Rooms are spacious and staff was friendly and engaged, in spite of being a very busy weekend with many requests for ""late checkout"" due to the Marathon on Sunday.
Reasonable rates, attentive staff and free breakfast - would happily return!We went to Seattle for my niece's wedding last August. Most of the family voted to stay at this Hampton Inn because it was relatively close to the wedding site (Rose Garden - Woodland Park Zoo) and it was affordable for everyone.
We were pleasantly surprised at how close it was to the Seattle space needle, Ducky tours (that was a blast!), monorail (which then brought us to Pike's Market). We were in Seattle for just an overnight stay, just to attend the wedding, but because of the hotel's lcation, we were actually able to see and enjoy Seattle's top attractions. What a treat!!!
The hotel itself had pretty standard amenities. Bed was comfortable, room was clean, even though our room was by the street, it was quiet. Breakfast was what you'd expect and was adequate. 
The staff, however, was pretty good. They were very helpful, courteous and accommodating. 
I have no problems recommending this hotel and would stay here again.
Room was comfortable, we weren't Sleepless in Seattle. LOL.We arrived early in the afternoon and check-in staff arranged for us to get into our room straight away (we'd been traveling from Australia and *really* wanted to get some sleep before we fell down). Amina at the front desk was cheerful and friendly and got us checked in and up to our room in short order, which was great.
The room is average size, and feels very warm and welcoming. The beds are great.Arrived from Australia & stayed here for 3 nights in early November. Great location for visiting the Space needle (5 min walk). Pikes Market (5 min monorail then short walk), Boeing Factory (45 min drive) and Seattle outlet shopping (50 min drive). The mono rail station is at the Space Needle and takes you right into town where you can walk to shops & restaraunts. Had dinner at the Cheescake Factory (very busy). There are many restaurants & bars to choose from. After dinner it's simply a short walk to the mono rail to come back to the hotel. The hotel is a 45min drive from the airport. Seattle was much more than I expected and we really enjoyed our weekend in this great city. This Hampton is typically great value, good staff, clean rooms and convenient location. Our room was large and had a view of the Space Needle. Only gripe was having to pay for parking but it was easy and safe to access the hotel. Would stay here again.The hotel is very nice. It is convinient to downtown Seattle and has really good restaurants close by. There is a QFC grocery store that is just a block away and a seven Eleven that is really close.
The rooms are very spacious i stayed in a regular room it did not have a frdge or a microwave. But if you book a suite than the room is quite a bit bigger and better equipted with appliances..
The breakfast is really good it has all the foods you need for breakfast..
overall really nice place...Checked in with no issues, staff was courteous and was quite willing to answer our questions. My major issues with this hotel were basically about the security....We were walking back to the hotel after getting off the lite rail about 6pm and were being followed by someone who was verbally abusive and attempting to catch up to us and make contact and not in a nice way. We were actually trotting by the time we reached the lobby of the hotel. When we got inside there was no one behind the front desk, no one in sight and the person followed us in to the hotel. We dashed for our rooms and locked ourselves in. Later, when I left the room to go get coffee the person was outside on the sidewalk and started back in when he saw me. Again, no staff in the front and had to dash for the room again as this person came in. This was just wrong! Safety in a big city needs to be primary and it was not. I personally would never stay in this hotel again and would advise anyone else to be careful if they choose to.We stayed here with a very large group of people from New York. Even though there were a lot of us arriving at once, check-in was smooth and the staff was very courteous. The room was nice and clean, with great water pressure in the shower. Free hot breakfast was nice too. The staff helped us a lot with getting around the city, and referring us to car services and cab companies.We were looking for a hotel that could accommodate our large family's pre-cruise stay (five rooms) and happened upon the Hampton Inn on 5th Avenue. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much considering the price; however, I was certainly surprised by what we found. Not only were the reservation staff personable and accommodating, they were extremely helpful with our transportation both from the airport (different flights/times) and to and from the pier. They work with a local transportation company and everything went like clockwork ... we were met at the airport on time, getting to the ship was a breeze and they met us at the pier to get some of us to the airport and the rest back to the hotel. (And their rates were very reasonable!)
The hotel itself is typical of a Hampton Inn but I think it's the staff that really makes this particular hotel a gem. To a person, they were warm and friendly -- even when their guests were not. It was quite apparent that this hotel is routinely recommended for cruise passengers as the staff managed the hordes of people very efficiently. The rooms were clean and well appointed and I was extremely impressed that they provided suites for the members of our party with children (four in a room). The only downside to our rooms was the fact that they, like most older hotels, have older, external mount air conditioners which I don't care for due to their noise.
The location of this hotel couldn't have been better. My husband and I stayed here for two nights prior to our cruise so we had time to ""explore"". It is right down the street from the Seattle Center (Space Needle) where we caught the monorail to downtown ... right after having lunch at a fantastic pizza parlor, Zeek's. In addition, I had made dinner reservations at two restaurants which were highly rated on TripAdvisor and both were within walking distance of the hotel ... which was a real ""plus"" in my book. Oh, the neighborhood is quite safe which made walking to the restaurants quite pleasant. 
Everyone in our party agreed that this hotel was a great place to stay and that we would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Seattle.While in Seattle for the Rush concert we choose Hampton Inn & Suites to stay. The location was a perfect location. Close to the Seattle center and Key arena, short walking distance. It was also close to the mono rail to ride down to downtown to get to Pike's Place and the water front. The view from our room on the 6th floor was a nice view of the city. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely stay there again when we return to the Seattle area.This hotel is in a great neighborhood with a very low crime rate, and the breakfast is actually not bad. Parking is limited, though they do have underground parking available. Complimentary wi-fi is easily accessible.If you have a car.. parking is very limited! And if you park in the garage be sure and ask for specific directions to your room. You can get lost and spend a lot of time figuring out that if you have room number 5xx,you don't take the elevator from the parking garage to the 5th floor which has rooms 5xx.
Otherwise, no surprises.. typical Hampton.Seattle is a favourite city to visit. Our primary purpose this time was to see the Minnesota Vikings play the Seahawks. The Hampton Inn was a reasonably priced, conveniently located. comfortable starting point. The location in the Queene Anne area adjacent to Fifth Avenue allows for easy driving connections to downtown, close proximity to the monorail or a stroll through the funky neighbourhood and visits to some interesting shops. The front desk staff were very welcoming, friendly and efficient. Our room with a king size bed was comfortable, super clean and filled with useful amenities. The breafast options were plentiful and the room set aside to eat breakfast was exceptional. The parking fee of $15 is a sign of the times I guess but it did ensure a secure parking location for our vehicle and was certainly not unreasonable. This hotel is a very good option for a Seattle visit .It's an experience like ours tonight that wins long term loyalty. Kyle Simmons who was on the front desk was terrific in handling the problem we had checking in - when I made our reservation ( non cancel able ) I made a mistake on the month putting in December 8th vs. November 8th. My wife and I showed up tonight - the 8th- and found that we didn't have a room booked.
Kyle was excellent - he realized what had happened before we did and before telling us what had happened found us another room - the last one available as it turns out. He also called the reservation center explained the situation and was able to reverse the non-cancelable December booking without being asked!
Outstanding customer service, and I know that starts with management. We always have had great experience with Hampton, well located, with clean comfortable rooms, welcome cookies, and great breakfasts but this kind of customer care is just excellent. If you haven't tried Hampton's you should!This hotel is built in a strange configuration so you end up taking long walks on long corridoors on different levels to reach you room.
However having got there it was worth it - I had a suite which had a Kitchen and sitting room with a fireplace.
Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size - No safe in the room was the only amenity that I was wanting for,
Complimentary breakfast in the lobby was no frills but fine.
Great location near the Space Needle and the Gates foundation , just a 15 minute walk or so into the City .
Happy to recommend.My daughter and I went to a concert at Key Arena I wanted a hotel that was within walking distance and a reasonable price. I've stayed at the Hampton Inn in Spokane Wa. and loved it, so I was hoping for the same. Our room was clean and the beds were very comfy and across the street there was a nice restaurant where we had happy hour drinks and appetizers. The next morning we left our car in the parking garage and walked to the monorail and went to Pikes Market. Nice hotel and great price.Excellent choice for one or two nights (pre or post cruise...)
Friendly staff; shuttle to cruise terminal, close to the Space Needle and stop for a hop on, hop off bus touring Seattle.
Room equipped with coffe-making facilities, free wi-fi and cable tv, fridge and microwave.
Breakfast included in the room rate, fair pricePerfect location for a visit to the new Chihuly Garden & Glass at Seattle Center. Many fine restaurant choices within walking distance, plus you can take the monorail from Seattle Center to downtown in 5 minutes.
Hotel staff and housekeeping staff are friendly and very helpful, rooms are nicely sized. One major issue though: the floors creak. Hard to get a good nights sleep with are the creaking.The location is good for going to the city center and it was nice to have a suite, but the room was disappointing for the price we paid. Breakfast was good and it was really nice to have secure parking in the garage under the hotel.I stayed one night at this Hampton Inn last week. Making the reservation was with ease thanks to Javier. The staff at the front desk on arrival was helpful and friendly. The room was comfortable and clean. Location of the hotel was within blocks of the Space Needle. The hotel was a very ambitious walk downtown but for me a pleasure. The front desk did give me directions to the Link monorail.... It was close to public transportation. I felt very safe walking the streets alone through many different neighborhoods. Hopefully I can return to Seattle for a longer period of time and definitely will stay at this Hampton Inn.We were here on Seafair weekend and it was very busy...front desk was swamped and it took a while to check in, but not their fault. The place is very large and it was quite a long haul to get baggage to our room without the use of a luggage trolley. Only saw one in use. Parking was a little difficult due to some remodeling, but turned out ok.
That said- our stay of several nights was excellent. Due to lack of availability of other rooms we were in a suite which was spacious (including a small kitchen area) , spotless, very comfortable (as was the bed) and quiet. Would definitely stay here again.Visited Seattle for two nights with another couple. We were planning to visit several venues at the Seattle Center so the Hampton Inn Seattle Downtown fit the bill for ease of access. It was only 3 blocks away and an easy walk. Since we didn't have to use our vehicle we saved on parking at the center. I booked two King rooms. Theirs was a standard room and ours was a huge suite with microwave, fridge, easy chair and couch, plus a table with four chairs and a work desk (Room 401). We frequently stay at Hiltons and this one was very nice. The complimentary breakfast was great with a large assortment of items to choose from. The breakfast area was kept spotless even though it was getting a lot of business. Kudos to the staff there. The front desk was helpful and professional moving a lot of customers in and out. Every time I passed by they were answering questions or giving directions to places to eat or visit or just being friendly with them. Great customer service Hampton!! The only drawback we experienced was that we were driving a large SUV and couldn't fit into the covered parking garage and the outside parking spots were made for compacts as well as being full. There is a parking area on an adjacent lot that can also be used if necessary.We found the location of this hotel to be ideal, and the suite was very comfortable. We had a few issues that were annoying but management was very receptive to addressing.
The beds are very comfortable, the balcony a treat, and the location couldn't be better 
as it is a short walk to the Space Needle. From the Space Needle you can take the Monorail to downtown Pikes Market if you want to see this popular tourist destination.Whenever we travel, my husband and I try to stay at Hampton Inn's. Some are good, some not so good, this one was great. I booked a king size room, nothing special because lets face it all you are doing is sleeping there. Well, we were informed when we checked in pre cruise, that we had been upgraded to a suite, unexpected and pleasant surprise. The desk staff is exceptional and extremely helpful. Our room spectacular. No great view but, we didn't feel like we were cramped in a hotel room. Our second surprise came when we came back after the cruise for 3 days and found we were upgraded again to a suite. We loved the size of the rooms and really we didn't want to leave. The beds and linens are clean and comfortable and Hampton Inn has by far the best pillows I have ever slept on. The hotel is four blocks from the Space Needle and Chihuly gardens. Also is 4 blocks from the Seattle monorail system which is an easy on/off to downtown attractions. This hotel is also 1 block from a very nice 24 hour grocery store which we used to bring food back to the room. It is in a great location and we were thoroughly impressed with our stay there. They also offered complimentary hot breakfast from 6-10 AM.Pros:
- Well located, near the Space Needle and the Glass Museum.
- There is a grocery store one block away.
- The hotel and the room were very clean and the room was spacious (fridge, counter space, microwave, etc.)
- Very good continental breakfast with lots of options.
Cons:
- We had some trouble with the wireless Internet, but fortunately there was a cable in the room so we have been able to connect the computer to the Internet anyway.
- Not well soundproofed...could hear everything that was happening in the hallway.
- Not enough room to eat the breakfast in the common room, so had to get back to the room with the food (game weekend...)
- Very noisy toilet
- Rust stain in the shower
Overall we had a very nice stay (one night) and I would stay there again. The free continental breakfast was very nice and I could have stayed longer considering the fridge and microwave in the room. It took a long time to get a taxi when we left but the staff was helpful.We stayed here prior to a cruise. We travel extensively and only stay at Hampton Inns, which we find are consistently good. I have to say that this Hampton Inn was the best one we have stayed in with regard to the staff and quality of service. From the moment we stepped in their door we were greeted with warmth and they could not do enough to make your stay a good one. We were also impressed with the breakfast, which was the standard for this chain, but stood out from any of the other Hampton Inns we have used because it was so clean and well supplied. The manager was going from table to table asking if all was okay and then the lady who was taking care of the breakfast area, came and took away our plates etc for us. The location is wonderful, right near the Space Needle and close to transit. We are walkers, so we found it convenient to even walk down to the waterfront and Pikes Market. If you are going on a cruise, they also offer a shuttle service to the port for a nominal fee. We couldn't be more pleased with this hotel. They exemplify what good customer service is all about.We spent a long weekend at this property. The building consist of the original building, and an addition of suites. We had a room in the original part (being a Diamond HH member, thought I might get an upgrade). Our room was a basic Hampton Inn room with no frills or extra space. We found the room quiet, and the HVAC worked well. The complimantery breakfast was the usual Hampton Inn grub, but did include real fresh fruit! The breakfast attendants were very friendly and attentive and kept the breakfast area clean and stocked. Was not an issue for us, but there is no pool at this property. We were within walking distance of many of the space needle attractions, and 8-10 resturants (5-6 blocks).First off great location, walking distance to the Space Needle and the monorail into Downtown Seattle, which was a bonus.
We booked this hotel as it was cheaper than others we found online, and we were coming in from Victoria via the Victoria Clipper. First impression, the receptionist was cheery, polite and very welcoming, something we were both appreciative off. The room was large and was spotless, and the bathroom clean. We were a bit concerned as our room was next to housekeeping, but we didn’t hear any noise at all. An added bonus was that opposite our room was a laundry room, which we made use of. If only more places had this facility as we found it most useful, having been moving from different places in Canada down to Seattle. 
The Breakfast was large and varied and included in the price of the room. Fresh Fruit, cooked foods, or make your own waffles. Very appreciated after staying in two other hotels who didn’t even offer breakfast. Overall we were very impressed and made a note to try and find other Hampton Inns and Suites on our travels.We picked this hotel for our two nights before heading off on a 7-day cruise to Alaska. It turned out to be a great location since we did not rent a car until our third night when we made a quick trip up to Vancouver. We were able to take a city bus up to Kerry Park for the BEST view of the city (and we lucked out with a clear evening to see Mt. Rainier! We took another bus back to the Space Needle and had a lovely dinner in the revolving restaurant at the top. (Expensive, but superb).
The hotel is just a few blocks from the monorail which will get you into Seattle shops and business district.
The hotel layout is a bit unusual in that it's like a u-shape configuration and we had read reviews on noise but did not have any problem with this during our two-night stay. The staff was helpful and friendly. Breakfast area is quite small but we enjoyed the varied fare that was offered. Room was clean and comfortable.This hotel is clean comfy and cozy! Good coffee, great hotel rates. I don't like the breakfast, but yogurts good and it's free! Staff is excellent! This ham tons best secret in hotel industry! I always look for them in every city! :)We stayed at this property before our Alaskan cruise. From the hotel, it was an easy walk to the Space Needle, Chihuly Exhibit, and the monorail. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was varied. There is a grocery store right out the front door. Would definitely stay here again.We were okay staying here. They do extra things like good coffee all day in the lobby. They have flavored water, with cucumbers or lemons. It varies each day. They put good choc. chip cookies at the desk in the evenings. We needed help with the hair dryer, and it was resolved immediately by a pleasant young man who came to our room and fixed it. Hampton Inn is always clean, and this room was up to their cleanliness standards. We stayed two nights. In addition to the room, we were charged $15 each night for parking in their lot. When we were getting ready to check out, my husband found a citation on our windshield from the ""parking service"". It stated we were in violation. We must pay $30, and after 15 days it goes up to $73! We had already been charged $15/day and had placed the blue parking ticket on our dash as instructed. Apparently, the blue tag had slid down a bit, but was visibly on the console. My husband gave the citation to Laimara at the front desk. She said she would take care of it. Not wanting to go back to Texas, and end up with a surprise $73 charge to the license plate on our rental car, I asked her for something signed - stating that this citation was voided. She abruptly told me ""We don't sign anything."". She gave me a copy of the citation. I spent the last day of our vacation on the phone with the parking service, in an effort to confirm that it had indeed been voided. It's unfortunate that one negative person can change a good experience to a fair one.The title says it all. If you want to stay in this location, and all you need is a clean and comfortable room, and the price is right, this will fill the bill. The included breakfast is also just like every other Hampton that we have ever stayed at--which means ""adequate"".Great location space needle out our patio door. Full kitchen and refrigerator The only thing you have to walk the entire third floor to get to the suites. There was only one way in and out. Long way to push a luggage cartHotel is about a 20-25 minute walk from the center of the downtown area and a 5 minute walk to Space Needle attractions.. Large, clean, quiet, comfortable room. There is a monorail stop at the Needle. Breakfast was ""fair"" and very crowed when we arrived at 8:30 a.m. The staff was excellent and VERY friendly and polite. Front desk provided us with two excellent restaurant recommendations. On site parking is provided for a reasonable $15 charge per night. If I ever return to Seattle, I would stay at his hotel again.Large, clean, quiet, comfortable room. Five minute walk to Space Needle and surrounding museums and attractions. Hotel is about 1.2 miles from the center of the downtown area. You can walk to downtown or take the monorail which has a stop at the Space Needle. Breakfast was ""OK"" and very crowed at 9:00 a.m.......fewer people at 7:00 a.m. and we had no trouble finding an empty table. Friendly accommodating staff. Covered parking available at $15.00 per night. I would stay at his hotel again. I can't rate value since we stayed for free using Hilton Honors points.This hotel seems to be a major staging point for Alaska cruises and they're very knowledgeable about all the ships and piers. We stayed here before and after our cruise and each weekend morning at breakfast the lounge was filled with travelers going or coming from one. The breakfast is free and included waffles, cereal and fruit. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel location isn't as close to the center of downtown as the name implies, but it's a short walk to the Space Needle and monorail and for $2.25 you can be downtown in a few minutes. A walk to the hotel from the same spot downtown takes about 25 minutes. The staff is happy to store luggage while you explore the city before check-in or after checkout (we did both), but this was the only area I had a problem with. We gave them our bags after checking out, but before we were to catch the shuttle to the ship. After a nice walk and lunch we returned and they couldn't find our luggage. The shuttle driver was kind enough to wait for us as they searched, but after 10 minutes he was ready to leave. At that point they got me involved in looking. There was little organization to their storage and I wasn't able to find the bags either. Finally, after another five minutes, and after they abandoned the search, I found the missing bags in a corner buried under larger pieces of luggage. Luckily my wife was slow in getting off the shuttle bus and we left soon after. To the hotel's benefit, when we retrieved our luggage the second time at check-in, they found them immediately. There are a few nice restaurants nearby and we enjoyed very good meals at Crow and Bahn Thai.We stayed at the hotel for one night prior to an Alaskan cruise from Seattle. For us, we found the location very good. It is a block from the Space Needle and easy walking distance to stores and restaurants. On the morning of the cruise, we had a decent free breakfast and then took their very convenient shuttle to the cruise terminal. At $5 per person, the shuttle provided a quick reliable way to get to the cruise terminal - definitely worth the cost. The hotel was very clean and comfortable, and we found the staff very freindly and helpful. We thought that for the location and quality of the hotel, the cost was very reasonable.The Hampton Inn chain has done a really odd thing. They asked their guests, “What do you want in a hotel?” And then they gave it to them! Hamptons aren’t posh but they are clean and comfortable. This hotel has really clean rooms, free in-room Wi-Fi, many, many power points in really handy locations and free breakfast. 
This hotel is in a great location for events at the Seattle Center and easy access to downtown and at the same time it is quiet area. Since it was a short visit and I didn’t have any problems, I only spoke with the front desk staff, who were friendly and professional. 
The only drawbacks are the breakfast area which has an awkward set up and can be crowded and the coffee (both in the breakfast area and in room) is horrid, which in Seattle is a crime. Next time I plan to grab one of their To Go breakfast bags and get coffee on the outside.While this hotel, listed as a downtown location, is not really downtown, it's still very convenient. It's a block from the Space Needle and all that surrounds it. There's a great grocery store nearby. It's also on the bus line. All the southbound buses take you to downtown in minutes. The hotel itself is comfortable and very clean. The staff is very friendly, very courteous and very helpful. This was a great place to call home for several days.At the end of a long day, my friend and I were desperate for a room for the night. We had trouble booking online through a discount website. When we looked at the hotel down the street we tried bidding on, we knew we would not be happy there. We decided to walk into the Hampton Inn & Suites and take our chances....,,
Wat a great experience it turned out to be. Kyle greeted us warmly and although he couldn't match the rate we had hoped to get at the crappy place down the street, he did give us a great GREAT room. A suite, actually. We were so comfortable there. A real oasis. We encountered a staff person as we negotiated our way to the room, and he offered several times to Eli with my ag. I finally relented. He was pleasant and helpful and kind and understanding. 
In the morning we again encountered a wonderful, thoughtful and warm staff mber. We also used the office area to print boarding passes and were Rey impressed by the huge crowd in the lobby enjoying the complimentary breakfast. Best fruit bowl ever! Not a single piece of honeydew!! Very ample breakfast buffet. Really quite ice. Bountiful, even.
I would not hesitate to go back. Worth the extra we ended up paying over our goal dollars.This hotel staff gets it...all employees were pleasant, even the middle of the night staff (most of us travelers know it is rare that this person has a personality!)...clean, great breakfast that included omelets (not cooked to order but good) and fresh fruit daily. Near everything, staff gave us great running courses. If there are negatives, outdoor sitting areas are limited though there is one area on the lower level we found and the fitness room is weak, nothing but cardio equip. No ""sleepless in Seattle"" here, beds very comfy.Family trip via Seattle to Alaska (we stayed here 3 nights). Great location. Wonderful and friendly staff. Clean, affordable, and comfortable. Nice hot breakfast with plenty of choices. 24 hour coffee and flavored (fresh lemon or lime iced) water, and in the late afternoon, a variety of Otis Spunkmeyer warm cookies. If I visit the Seattle downtown area again, this will be my first choice of hotel. I also used the fitness center; small, but adequate. All equipment in good working order and sanitizer available. There is no pool, indoor or out. Some photos attached (including the view to the Space Needle). Highly recommended.We flew into Seattle and needed a hotel for an overnight stay before boarding our cruiseship at pier 91 on sunday. This was typical Hampton Inn. The room was clean and had all the normal amenities. The checkin area was too small. But, the hotel was booked with alot of people doing what we were doing. Several nice features about the hotel 1 - they offered bag storage 2 - they had arrangements for vans to take you to the dock ($4:00/person) 3 - The hoten is in easy walking distance to the Seattle Center - Space Needle ETC, ETC. A great way to spend to morning before heading to the ship.Stayed here recently for two nights. The plusses:
- Very friendly and accommodating staff.
- Quick and easy check-in and check-out.
- Clean and quiet rooms.
- Within walking distance of major attractions, such as the Space Needle.
- Within walking distance of Pike's Place Market (although it is a long walk, about 2 miles each way.)
- Good free breakfast (usual Hampton Inn breakfast buffet of hot and cold.)
The minuses:
- Indoor parking spaces are incredibly tight and difficult to get into.
- And $15 per day for parking? Really? For spaces that were difficult to get into and out of.
- Toilet wasn't flushing properly and started filling up with hot water. I notified the front desk and they said it was fixed while we were gone, but even though it flushed properly, it was filling up with hot water. Very weird. Never saw, or felt, a toilet bowl using hot water.The hotel was a maze to get to your room. We actually had to bring our luggage in a cart down a fairly steep hill to get to the door closest to our room. We were afraid it would become a runaway cart and run into cars. Then, on the way out, yep, up the hill. Not fun. The room we had was actually very nice - a suite with a kitchen. The hotel was very clean which is ""the"" all important factor for me. Just want to warn anyone who is not in good shape - beware of the hill!I've stayed at this hotel twice now and really enjoy it. It is clean and quiet. The breakfast is standard Hampton Inn fare. The price is much more affordable than the downtown hotels. The location is amazing - you are right next to the Space Needle, EMP, Chihuly Garden and Glass and the Monorail. We don't mind walking, so we just walked downtown to restaurants and Pike Market. Also, a full grocery store is right across the street. If you have a car, it's $15/day to park.We were staying 1 night and found this hotel met our needs, close to everything , we had a function that we were attending and it was close by.
Very friendly service , we were upgraded to a suite and that was a bonus, too bad we weren't staying more then 1 night. 
Definitely will stay here again, as we are in Seattle quite often.We were able to stay in Seattle for 2 nights and really enjoyed the city. Hampton Inn was only a few short blocks from the Space Needle and less than 2 miles from Pike's Market. We were able to walk to every attraction we planned to see. The suite was very nice and had a large kitchen and separate bedroom. We could even see the Space Needle from our balcony. The cookies and breakfast were very tasty. Everything was very clean and comfortable. The only amenity we wished they had was a pool/hot tub...but we wouldn't have had much time to enjoy them anyhow. I used my hilton honor points to stay and thought it was a great value for the amount of points used.This hotel was perfect for our needs. Close to major attractions. Attractive price. Good clean rooms. Free hardy breakfasts every morning. Very friendly service. If you are going to Seattle with a family, you really can't do better.Room was good with good view. Breakfast area was well maintained. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Our first night there we were on foot to restaurants and space needle. This appears to be a good neighborhood in Seattle. Outside of being downtown near Pike Market, this was an ideal location.Stayed three nights and were put in room meant for physically challenged folks. The shower was a problem, as there is no edge to keep water from rest of bathroom. Room fan was loud and we just used ear plugs. To be fair to the hotel, we never really went and complained or took the issues to them to give them a chance to correct the situation, the desk was always busy as we were coming and going, we had three days there and were doing alot of touring. My husband finally found them freed up on our last day and they expressed concern and offered to change rooms for the last night, which we declined, as we discovered an error in our planning and had to leave a day early to catch a ferry to Canada. 
The lovely lady that kept breakfast area stocked and tidy was great! Room nice and clean, location great! Very close to space needle and other attractions. Just take the monorail to downtown to get to Pike's market....This is a good hotel for a quick stay in the Seattle Downtown area. We read many of the reviews prior to booking and it sounded fine. We did think it would be a lot closer to the Pike's Place Public market - in fact we thought within walking distance - which it is not. Not a big deal but that would have been cool. This is a normal Hampton Inn with good beds and free breakfast so we were satisfied. The front desk staff was polite and helpful. If you do stay here there is a great ""whole foods"" type grocer within a 1/2 mile walk.We arrived a little early for check in, so we had to wait, but the staff gave us a direct line to call to check when the room was ready. We went out, did some sightseeing, returned because we were done, and the room still wasn't ready. The pushed the room through housekeeping, and come to find out they upgraded us to a one bedroom suite, no charge. The room was nice, the decor good, and the bed comfortable. It was extremely close to all the major tourist stuff, close to the tram to take you to downtown, and the price was pretty good too. I would definitly stay here again!My wife and I chose this hotel for its proximity to the home of a Seattle friend and on balance found it acceptable. Adjacent to Seattle Center, it made the Chihuly gallery, the monorail and Frank Gehry's exuberant ""music experience"" blob building easy to walk to. And the Queen Anne Hill neighborhood has mild charms all its own, not least of which an excellent QFC supermarket a short block away. 
There were, however, some odd points about the place. The small and awkward plot of land may be responsible for the split level organization of the floors (and the fact that the lobby floor is 3). Harder to understand is the placement of the elevator at the end of a ramped-up, very long corridor of rooms: why not in the lobby? The breakfast--part of the deal--was indeed hot (eggs, sausage, self-made waffles) and varied (granola, fruit, etc) and served for a long stretch, but the feeling of crowds, crowds, crowds, blaring TV sets on different channels, often unsupervised young kids, and some badly-arranged buffet features took some of the charm away. And though it is hard to fault careful housekeeping, very early morning vacuuming added to the banging of room doors to create an unpleasantly noisy environment.I've stayed in a lot of Hamptons and this one scores in many ways. The location, while not exactly downtown, is walking distance to the Space Needle, Chihuly Museum and the Music Experience. It's also close to the Monorail, which gets downtown in about 2 minutes. There's a great full service grocery market right across the street. Breakfast was generous with many choices. The rooms weren't bad, but our experience was marred by a very noisy AC unit - the extremely annoying kind that turns off and on with a clunk every 30 minutes. We couldn't open the window because of the street noise, so it was a stuffy few nights. The staff was friendly even with a slightly chaotic, fully booked hotel. But they did nothing to acknowledge my Honors status, which other properties have done.A good value for the location. Within walking distance of many attractions. Very nice rooms and a great free breakfast. Many interesting places in the Queen Anne neighborhood and some beautiful old homes.Nothing special to share for potential visitors. It sits a couple blocks from Seattle Center (Space Needle) and convenient to the monorail to get you in to town. They provided a nice list of restaurants that are walking distance. Parking garage is $15. Breakfast is what you expect (waffles, yogurt, fruit, egg-stuff). No surprises -- which, when booking at hampton, is what you are looking for!What an excellent surprise, We stayed 3 nights there and everything was perfect.
The room was big and comfort, breakfast was amazing, There are 2 computers and free coffee in the lobby, there's a bus stop and a big supermarket just infront of the hotel, but most of all... the staff: As we checked in we asked for a room with a fridge, within 5 minutes they brought a mini fridge to our room. Every question (and we had many...) was answered immediately. When we were sitting in the lobby waiting for our boys the lady from the front desk came and offered a variety of snacks. We enjoyed it very much and looking forward to come back.We were very pleasantly surprised by just how good this hotel is. Close to Seattle Center, within walking distance of the monorail, good breakfasts, very accomodating staff and the most comfortable beds we have enjoyed in any hotel. The only drawback is paying $15 per day for parking. but in seattle, parking costs a lot of money. we will definitely be back in Seattle and when we do return, this is where we are staying.This Hampton is above average for a Hampton. It is close enough to Downtown without being right in the middle of downtown. A quick bus ride (15 min or less) or a 8 dollar taxi fare takes you into the main downtown area, or you can walk a few blocks and catch the monorail back downtown. The hotel has a standard Hampton breakfast, and the staff was super friendly and efficient. My only gripe is that the fitness center was subpar with some pretty beat up equipment; it was useable, but a bit disappointing. The hotel also has a nice set of mini-suits and with a QFC grocery store across the street (and plenty of dining within a few blocks), it makes a great hotel choice for business and travelers wishing to avoid the tourist trap hotels downtown.This hotel was a pleasure to stay at. Well located 4 blocks from the Seattle Center and the Space Needle plus the Monorail which takes you downtown in 2 minutes. From there the light rail takes you to most points of interest in Seattle. But back to the hotel. The desk staff goes out of their way to answer questions and help when needed. Rooms were very clean and well furnished, a quiet place and the breakfast was great with main dishes changed daily. Eggs, sausage gravy over bisquits, hot cereal, juices, even waffles daily. Beds were comfortable, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it.Perfect placed to stay the night before an Alaskan cruise. Shuttles available every 15 to 30 minutes to the cruise terminal for $9 per person. Several good eating within a few blocks of the hotel, and the Space Needle is a pleasant walk just 4 or 5 blocks away. We spent three hours touring Space Needle and Cuhuily Glass Exhibit on a Sunday morning, in plenty of time to catch the 1 p.m shuttle to the Princess dock. STaff is excellent. Complimentary breakfast was outstanding.My sister and I stayed here for a long weekend at the beginning of October. There really wasn't anything here to complain about! All of the staff were excellent, from the time we checked in until we left. I was able to add my sister to the room so she could get a key for late arrival, and we were both offered bottles of water when we came in. We took advantage of the breakfast each day and I thought it was pretty good for a free breakfast! Eggs and waffles every day, yum. There is also a grocery store right across the street, perfect for picking up snacks for the room. It's about 4 blocks from the space needle, which was about a 5-7 minute walk for us. From there you can take the monorail downtown, although the monorail only runs 1 mile, so it's walkable as well. It's in a nice, quiet neighborhood - even cracked the window to get some fresh air in the room. The front desk was able to arrange for a car service for my sister, and even had breakfast to go waiting for her on her way out the door at 5am. Our room was clean; bed was comfy, and housekeeping did a good job cleaning each day (they always came after we left each day and were gone before we'd arrive back mid-afternoon, which was nice.) Every employee we came across in the halls always said hello. A very friendly staff that seemed to go out of their way to help out their guests - it was much appreciated! I'd definitely come back and stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle.We stayed here for 5 nights during an anniversary trip to Seattle and we were very pleased. As Hampton Inn regulars, we know what to expect from a typical Hampton Inn, and this one exceeded our expectations. The room was very nice, very clean and the staff were all very pleasant and helpful. As many others have said, it is close to Seattle Center, making it easy walking distance to the Monorail and the Space Needle. This will definitely be our home base for any future visits to Seattle.Stayed there 1 night while attending an event at Seattle Centre. Easy walk to location and quick monorail ride to downtown for shopping and additional dining. Monorail (1962 Worlds Fair) goes from base of Space Needle to Westlake Centre @ 5th Ave. and Pine Street. Breakfast was what you would expect from Hampton Inn, Nothing fancy, good selection of hot and cold foods, etc. Had secure underground parking (stayed in a suite) and all staff we encountered were pleasant and helpfull. Has two bedroom/bath suite and exrtra room was great. AS usual great beds to sleep in! No problems with check in/out. A few restaurants within a block or two and a QFC at 5th and Mercer.Our family of 4 stayed in a king suite. The rooms are updated and clean. There was a full kitchen with granite counters and full on oven etc. The sheets and duvet are all white and washed every visit. The only complaint about the room is that there were absolutely no towel bars in our room. The complimentary breakfast was great although super crowded. Be ready to stand in line to make toast or get coffee on a busy week. This hotel is near the Seattle center and space needle and its a 20 min walk to downtown which can be tiring with kids. although there's a monorail that goes from Seattle center to downtown. the buses are great too.We've tried all kinds of hotel chains, and we were again very happy with the Hampton Inn & Suites. This hotel is a couple of blocks from the Seattle Center & Space Needle. The location is great even if you don't get views of Seattle or the water. From the Seattle Center, you can ride the monorail to downtown. The room was quiet, clean, comfortable, and had a nice contemporary feel. It had a mini fridge, microwave, and bar counter and sink. The bed and comforter were great. The hot breakfast included was good, and was much appreciated, as was the coffee service in the lobby. Service was prompt and professional. We parked underground which is a nice feature in rainy Seattle. Rates are reasonable. We're definitely going to keep this hotel in mind when we need to stay in Seattle.This is an outstanding hotel. Note there will be a parking charge if you have a car unless you have status with Hilton. Hotel is very close to the Space Needle. Layout of hotel is somewhat odd as it spans what appears to have been 2 separate hotels. 
Be sure to ask where to eat. There is a great area a short walking distance from the hotel. They supply a list but ask for directions. 
Staff was great!This hotel is located in quiet area of downtown Seattle. I loved the fact that everything was walking distance even pikes Market. I did not want to have to drive any further into downtown to try to find parking. The Space Needle was just about a block or two away. Pikes Market was about 5-6 blocks but not bad. We took the mono rail which was located fairly close to save on some walking. Very clean rooms- the breakfast was wonderful sausage,eggs, waffles, juice, fruits, cereals, etc. 
If I am ever in Seattle again I would certainly stay here. Location- cleanliness- comfort- safety
IGreat location near downtown Seattle. Hotel staff friendly and helpful. Easy access to public transportation. Our room was standard - nothing special, but clean and comfortable. The breakfast was also standard fare, but plentiful. Would stay here again.Great hotel. Upgraded to one bedroom suite treats hh diamonds well. Free wifi parking free for diamond members. Rooms spacious and modern even a contemporary fireplace! Cool!Hotel is walking distance to many attractions. Very clean and comfy room. The staff was helpful, although sometimes the main desk was staffed by only one person which caused some delay. The breakfast was very good, but the dining area is not sufficient for the amount of people there. The parking area was a bit tough to maneuver in, even with the compact car I rented.
Overall, a positive experience.We had stayed here before and knew that the rooms are very nice and clean. Breakfast is provided and very good though very crowded. We stayed here this time the night before our cruise which probably accounts for some of the crowds. Check-in went smoothly as we arrived at one of the few moments when there was no line. Easy walking distance to the Space Needle tho we didn't go there this time. Nice Thai restaurant about a block away (see separate review of Bahn Thai). The best part was the shuttle from the Hampton to Pier 66 (NCL's dock). We were the only ones who had reserved the 10 am shuttle, so they sent a town car for us! hooray! Ask about the shuttle when you check in.The location is a little off beat - not in the shopping district. But the hotel is very nice and seemed recently renovated I was upgraded to a suite which was very large and included a deck and fireplace. Some nice restaurants within walking distance. I would recommend to families or business travelers.Great staff, clean rooms, good breakfast, and close to the Space Needle and downtownClose to Space needle and EMP and duck rides parking lot was poor.Pros:
Walking distance to Space Needle, Kerry Park, close to downtown Seattle, shuttle to cruise port
Cons:
$15 parking unless you're a Diamond HHonors member, somewhat tight breakfast area on busy mornings
I travel weekly for work and, as a diamond HHonors member, typically stay at a Hampton Inn wherever I happen to be. This is the best Hampton Inn location I have stayed at. The property is conveniently located to several great tourist locations and restaurants. The staff was very friendly and professional. Our room, which was larger than most standard Hampton Inn rooms, had a view of the Space Needle, was very clean and the bathroom was excellent.
The only downsides are the parking situation, which is somewhat pricey at $15/day, and the crowded breakfast area (we stayed from a Sunday to Monday).
If my wife and I return to Seattle this will be our hotel.Upon entering our 2 bedroom suite with 5 people (2 adults & 1 child) we noticed we were going to be cramped for space. The unit had a full kitchen prep area, but no table/chairs to sit & eat. The living area had a queen sized pull out sofa which sat 2 people, an ottoman, & a business desk & chair. Where would all of us sit?? There was only 1 bath (as is the design in all suite units) so getting ready in the AM made it difficult. The bath had no stopper to use the tub for the child (""use a face cloth stuffed into the drain"" was the answer). The pull out sofa had no add'l sheets & it took a 2nd call (1 1/2 hrs.) to the main desk to request them, along with add'l. towels to accomodate our party of 5. The bedrooms with queen beds had no bureau storage for clothing - (1 bureau was in the living room used as a tv stand), no add'l tv's, & 1 room didn't have a working closet as it was nailed shut! AC units were in living area & 1 bedroom, none in 2nd bedroom. The full breakfast was very good, but with the amount of guests, seating was very limited. Parking was $15/night. The location was good as it is near the Space Needle, but we were disappointed of our accomodations, knowing what we paid for our 3 night stay.Five of us stayed in a corner 2 bedroom unit. Kitchen was great as was the living room. A suite was a better option for us than 2 rooms. However, had I known that there was only one bathroom, I might have reconsidered. We would have prefered a unit with a king room and a second room with 2 doubles or queen beds. The suites apparently all have king beds in both rooms.
NO POOL. Good continental breakfast. Really nice staff. 
Close to City Center and all of the venues including the Space Needle and museums. 
Area roads are under construction and make finding the hotel a bit of a challenge. Our GPS even got confused!Just two minutes walk from the Space Needle and all the attractions of the Seattle Centre, the location of this Hampton couldn’t be more convenient. It’s an easy walk too to the Pike Place Market and downtown. 
We enjoyed the spaciousness of our suite and its terrace had a great view of the Space Needle. The fully equipped kitchen overlooked a large living room complete with fireplace. The bedroom was also roomy and had a second TV. Outside the bathroom were two dressing areas. The suite was quiet and sleep quality was good. 
It was possible to forget we were in a hotel. It felt more like we had an apartment in Seattle. 
Complimentary breakfast in the large breakfast room was well up to Hampton’s standard and the hot food was especially appetising. The buffet was kept attractive and freshly stocked by the vigilant staff who also cleared tables. 
For a short term or longer stay in Seattle, this hotel is a good bet.The Inn is 4 small blocks from the needle and mono rail ,bus just outside the front door. Japanese restaurants close by, super market QFC open till very late one block away. The suite which we had was really nice and comfortable with everything that we needed. Laundry was only a short distance away from our suite $1 per load. Breakfast was fine and the computer in the reception area plus wifi in our room all free. Lastly the staff were very helpful, we had a great stay.What you expect from a Hampton Inn
Pretty good overall, standard breakfast with omelettes etc…
Bus route direct to downtown stops by the hotel
Nearby QFC grocery store and restaurants in the area.
Walking distance (5 minutes) from the Space needle park.
Difficult to walk in the area as roads are blocked for construction
The room was good, as what you typically find at Hamptons
Friendly front desk staff 
Good concierge service – they kept our luggage for more than 12 hours prior our 
trip to the airport (tip: use bus and transit train for a few $)I needed a place to stay near the south end of Lake Union so this location was perfect. The hotel was very clean and was more modern and updated than most Hamptons. Service was very good and, except for a parking lot resurfacing incident, I had no problems to report during the stay. The rooms were spacious and quiet with a large bath. The shower could use a little more water pressure but everything else was fine. The bed was very comfortable, as with all Hamptons. As a Diamond member parking was free but I believe they normally charge $15 per night.
The neighborhood is called Lower Queen Anne and is right next to the Seattle Center (Space Needle) area. Lots of restaurants to suit any taste and a very safe area to walk in.We were in a suite and change to regular room. Reg room better than the suite. Too long of walk to elevators in narrow hallways. Facilities nice but probably only a 2-3 star rating IMO.Excellent accomadations within walking distance of the space needle. Easy access to all the downtown transit and a helpful friendly staff to help one find their way!! Great experience!!Convenient location. This hotel was exceptionally clean. The bed was very comfortable. My room was very quiet and no outside noise could be heard. The breakfast was above average. High speed internet was good. Lots of good restaurants nearby. The $15 to park seemed a bit high.Overall my experience was EXCELLENT stayed 3 nights-- the rooms are clean & comfortable. The staff was excellent -- friendly, helpful & really went out of their way to make my stay excellent.
Breakfast was great -- staff was attentive, public areas are really clean and comfortable.
Exercise room is ""ok"" -- could use some upgrades. Parking is a premium -- I have a ""larger"" car so I parked it and didn't move until I left.Overall our experience at this hotel was good. However, don't bring an SUV and expect to park in their garage- the corners are tight and the spots are small. Also, if you are a light sleeper, consider asking for a top-floor room or bring earplugs. The floors squeak easily, so the person above you can be quite noisy, even if they're just walking around. Otherwise the hotel was great with helpful staff (they moved us to a top-floor room when we mentioned the problem).Fairly good location. 15 min walk to space needle monorail to get to pikes place. The breakfast was very very good for a complimentary breakfast. The rooms are clean and decently sized. Parking wasn't too expensive. Would stay here again.Felt the breakfast was lacking. Nobody could understand me. Rooms newly renovated smelled. Would not recommended ever. Worst hotel ever.We have been staying here every April for the world rhythm festival and while the rooms have have always been adequate and affordable the latest rounds of renovations have taken this hotel to a new high.
The once tired Lounge / breakfast room is now classy and clean. The breakfast buffet is the best I've seen and always plenty of it. The coffee was great the staff friendly and helpful. We will be back ext year and the one after that Etc.As a road warrier I've come to reply upon Hilton properties, in general, and Hampton Inn, in particular for a decent room, an adequate breakfast and a fair price. I chose this property due to its proximity to downtown Seattle. While I got what I expected (the usual Hampton Inn experience) this hotel offered more and reminded me of my two favorite Hampton Inn properties in Chicago and Manhattan. The front desk staff were beyond polite, always asking what they could do to help me. Questions were answered promptly and never did I have to wait for an answer. The room, I had a King Suite, was large, very clean and quiet. Because of my positive experience, my family is now considering this hotel for our ""home base"" for our summer, 2013, vacation. Highly recommended, especially if you are going to visit the Space Needle or the EMP museum. Oh, and the monorail (which you can catch at the Space Museum, will take you to within 4 blocks of Pike Place Market. (A little gem offered by the front desk staff and employed by me).This hotel is just a few blocks from the Space Needle. The streets are a bit odd with the one ways, they just made the GPS work a bit harder. The hotel has a very strange design, with two separate ""tower"" sections that are not connected. If you are in the rear section, the front elevators will not reach your floor, so you either walk all the way through to the back on the third floor, or do what we did--just walk outside the building, then use your card key for access to one of the many outer doors as this is much more convenient. The floor design is really odd. The fitness room is in the back corner of the rear building, it is small but adequate. Parking is tight, both surface and garaged, and they really did not disclose that there was a $15 per day charge until I checked in. The breakfast was expanded and really good with fresh fruit. Here is your tip: book the one bedroom suite rooms,mother have a fireplace (gas), a stove, full sized frig, microwave, sink, toaster, coffee maker and dishes. Ask for a room with a view of the Space Needle, they have a small patio too and you may get lucky and get a view of downtown also. I say this because there are some really lousy rooms on the first floor on 5th that have no view and are dark. For a few dollars more, using your AAA card, you can get a 1 BR suite for the same price as a stinky dark standard room. Lots of restaurants within walking distance as well as Key Bank and Seattle Center.I've stayed at this Hampton Inn quite a few times now. Pretty much every time I'm in Seattle for business I stay here because it fits right in with what my company will pay for a hotel. It's not an awful hotel as it has the usual Hampton Inn amenities but it's also not a great hotel for a few reasons. The first reason is that they have rooms literally right at the street level. As I'm writing this review there is a tour bus of teenagers exiting a bus right outside my room. Not the best way to end an evening when you'd like to get some sleep, and definitely no privacy. Second, as others have said, it's a hike to get from parking to the front desk. That wouldn't be so bad if there was actually parking that would fit a modern small to midsize car. I'm not exaggerating when I write that only Smart cars will fit in their parking garage. And it's such a deal for $15/night to park (why not just build it in to the room rate?).
It's not a bad hotel due to the proximity to I-5 and there are a few things nearby to try for restaurants but it definitely isn't the most happening neighborhood. And especially be careful when asking for a room as you are either right on top of the street (as I am), staring at HVAC units (the last trip), or getting a bird's eye view of the 7-11 behind the hotel (my first visit). I have yet to have a great room that has any privacy and I get the feeling that being a Hilton Honors member means absolutely nothing to this Hampton Inn.
This hotel is fine but I definitely wouldn't book it if you want a place where you can relax and get some work done in your room.My sister attended a Pottery convention in Seattle, and I decided to join her and explore the city. Because of the convention, all the hotels closest to the convention center were full and The Hampton Inn was the closest we could find on short notice. The Hotel was near the space needle and a monorail trip away from the downtown core (convention center). Keep in mind that on weekends, the monorail doesn't run until 9am.The hotel is on the major bus routes, and the buses are frequent to the city core. I arrived at The Hampton at 8:30am, exhausted after an early morning flight and our room was ready for me upon arrival. This was well appreciated! The hotel was more economical than the other chains in the downtown core, but wasn't lacking quality. Our room was squeaky clean and very comfortable. The staff members were friendly, helpful and cheerful. The breakfast was fresh and plentiful. There were 2 computers for guests' use in the lobby. The area around the hotel (Queen Ann Ave.) is very trendy and has many fabulous restaurants, a great market (with organic selections) and a wonderful cafe (top notch coffee and organic- gluten free baked goods) just across the street. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone who doesn't mind being on the outskirts of the downtown area.Checked into this property for a week of business travel. Unable to get a room at the two Homewood properties which are where I usually stay when in Seattle. Hotel is half renovated and a challenge to find during rush hour traffic. When I finally found the hotel, the parking garage was full as 1/2 of it is being used for construction equipement storage. Had to back all the way out of the garage and proceed to the other parking garage. That is when the fun surprise occured, you can't get to your room from the P2 garage. You have to hike with your luggage back up to the hotel lobby, then get the elevator to your room. This is not fun in 3 inch heels with a laptop, suitcase, and other stuff. Probably won't stay at this hotel again in the future. Also, no fridge or microwave in room....This hotel was a wonderful find! The location is excellent - a few blocks from the Space Needle and monorail to downtown. It is surrounded by really good, affordable restaurants (don't forget to check out the Steak and Pizza place across the street), as well as QFC for supermarket items. What makes it stand out though is its value for money. The rooms are large, comfortable and full of amenities. The staff are friendly and professional. The concierge was so helpful in calling cabs and giving directions to tourist attractions, restaurants, etc. It was also so wonderful to have a hot, complimentary breakfast buffet every morning. And, by the way, the hotel keeps a quality all-day coffee/tea station in its lobby - also complimentary to its guests. I will come back to this hotel without question!I was in Seattle recently for an opera. Based on a previous trip I knew there was a Hampton Inn nearby. YES!!! On north 5th St., just north of Mercer, is a Hampton Inn. Price is right and breakfast is included. It was convenient and comfortable. I may well go back (for more operas, of course) and plan to stay there again.
My ONLY comment is that the bathroom was meant for a giant--sink too high for me as was the hook on the back of the bathroom door. (NOT a complaint, as I dealt with it.)I usually stay at Hilton Garden Inn and above - I was a bit concerned about this hotel because of the location and the level. I will never pre-judge these hotels again...this was a GREAT hotel.
I will stay here again - absolutely.
The lobby area is very comfortable and updated, they have cucumber/lemon water that is quite refreshing available all day long as well as coffee.
The rooms are updated too, and very comfortable.
The hallways need to be taken care of (new paint, new carpet) - but by the looks of the underground parking garage - they are in the process of updating the entire hotel as several parking slots were taken up by carpet that has been removed from the hotel.
Very cool location, very close to the space needle, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and EMP (Experience Music Project) - all walking distance.
Looking forward to going back again.I stayed at this hotel twice in the last month. This is the only Hampton Inn near downtown Seattle, although it's not really close to the financial or retail districts. It is however close enough to the Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, etc) to walk. There are a large grocery store and a few restaurants immediately across the street. It has a broad variety of rooms available, including the type I stayed in, a suite with separate bedroom and full kitchen (including an actual oven, a true rarity for hotels). I also enjoyed the gas fireplace and the availability of a large walk-out patio. It seems like a portion of the property used to be condos or apartments before becoming a hotel. Like all Hampton Inn properties, the breakfast is good, and included in the room rate. Free internet access is also included, but painfully slow at times. Parking is not free, or cheap. It's also difficult to find a place to park after 8pm. The property was clean and well-maintained, and felt safe. The only additional gripes I can manage to recall are toilet seats that will not stay ""up"" (in both rooms I had), a broken ice maker in the kitchen freezer, no HD content for the HDTVs, and my first stay I had to call and request silverware, as there was none in the unit's kitchen.
Bottom line however, if I was returning I would definitely consider this hotel again, and you will likely enjoy your stay here.Wonderful location just a few blocks from the Space Needle. You can still walk to downtown or use the monorail. Several restaurants and a grocery store are also nearby. The staff is very friendly and helpful to visitors with regards to getting to attractions. You don't need a car ifyou stay here. They run shuttles to the cruise terminals as well. Breakfast is good and varied. A nice plus is the infused water available in the lobby. Internet service was a bit slow, but I was on vacation so I didn't care.Stayed here this weekend for the Color Run/Girls Weekend starting from the Seattle Center. I have stayed at ALOT of Hamptons and we chose them because of the consistancy of the stay. I am not a hyper critical reviewer but I will review as a perfectionist. The PROS: The staff was fantastic all friendly and helpful. Had to book a king bed, but wanted two beds which they easily changed for me at no cost. Breakfast offering is always well rounded, the rooms are clean. Coffee available all day and cookies in the evening. The location is key here. We parked the car and never used it all weekend, we walked to the monorail took it to westlank and then walked to Pike Place. After the race sunday it was great to walk back to the hotel to clean up!! The CONS: the parking is interesting, unless you have a tiny car the garage was a challenge with our Crysler 300, we did alot of manuvering to get in a spot. At 9am the breakfast area was so busy we couldnt not find a table, maybe they can use another room as overflow like the Queen Anne room down the hall. Coffee is very weak in the room but plenty strong downstairs.(WA girls need strong coffee)
We didn have a horrible Saturday night sleep. There were party girls next door and right above us, called our room 3 times from 1-3am, above us I felt it was so loud they must be moving furniture and cussing in the halls. I called the front desk and they handled my angry call with care (sorry I had had enough) and must have dealt the them quickly but took another 30minutes to quiet. Having the race the next morning was tough. At checkout I talked to desk and were very understanding and gave me a room credit for my next stay and any hotel a well as free parking. Actually more then I expected. 
If you are a very light sleeper I would request and inside room away from the street since we woke to a street argument Friday night as well. Overall, happy with our stay here. The hotel cant help what their guests do but they did handle it quickly. Would definately stay here again!I stayed at this hotel for two nights in May. The location is very convenient for travellers wishing to access downtown Seattle, Seattle Centre, the Space Needle, and Lower Queen Anne.
My room included a king bed, 32"" LCD TV, high-speed wireless internet, and complementary breakfast. The whole property was recently renovated so everything on the property is free, clean, and modern. The bathroom featured an large enclosed shower with sliding glass doors. The desk seemed to be a newer variety marble/granite and wood combination. I'm not sure what Hampton was getting at when they put a ""modern style"" desk chair in, however it was very uncomfortable (read, too much metal not enough padding). I'd have preferred a regular one over the more fancy looking metal deal they have. 
The property's suites are located in a different part of the hotel further from 5th Avenue. Due to the hotel being built on a hill, the lowest parking garage is only accessible from elevators located further from the front desk, as are the suites. Take a look at a satellite view of the hotel and you'll understand the layout of this specific hotel. It almost looks like two ""L"" shaped buildings joined together. One for the ""inn"" rooms and the other for ""suites"". 
Each morning from 6 till 10 a hot complementary breakfast is available. Choices included eggs (or omelettes), sausages, bacon, and potatoes as well as fruit, muffins, toast, cereals, and orange/cranberry/apple juice. Coffee/tea is also available throughout the day as is iced water. The breakfast dining area is small so it becomes somewhat hectic between 8 and 10. 
The staff at this location truly care and their attention to guests is clearly visible when you interact with them. Every employee I passed in the hallway acknowledged me and went out of their way to assist in any way possible. 
Located near Seattle Centre, this Hampton is very accessible to downtown via the monorail which takes you from Seattle Centre to the Westlake area (5th and Pine) in minutes. A per-arranged taxi to the airport is available for a flat rate of $40 USD and can be booked at the front desk. Travel time from the airport is about 20 minutes without traffic. You can also take the Light Rail from Westlake Station (accessible by bus or the monorail) to Sea-Tac airport .This hotel is in a great location, just a few blocks from the Space Needle. It was very clean and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. As with most Hampton Inns, the room did not include a refrigerator or microwave. There was a charge for parking and the parking lot did tend to fill up in the evening. Overall it was a great hotel especially for the price.You can tell if the management of a hotel pays attention to details by the cleanliness of the stairwells. This property does, pretty good, but could be better. The breakfast servers do a great job and fix a nice buffet. Paying $15 for parking is a bit hard to take. Plenty of restaurant options withing walking distance and a QFC grocery across the street. Maintenance could be improved by fixing door card readers.First, this is a good value. I paid just of $100 with the AAA rate.
The room was typical Hampton Inn, clean, furnishings fine, not great. The bathroom however must have been recently remodeled as it was very clean and current.
One troubling thing though: the bathroom only has a shower, no tub. So if you like a bathtub you are out of luck. I don't think they would have just given me a room without a tub without telling me so I am guessing none of the rooms have bathtubs.
Since we were only there one night, not having a tub didn't bother us.
Check in was a bit concerning. When I asked for a quiet room the clerk seemed a bit put off, confused, said she didn't know which room might be more quiet. She said this room faces street X, this room faces street Y. I am not from Seattle so street X and Y mean nothing to me.
After some difficulty on her part she gave me a room on the 5th floor.
My fears were unfounded as it turned out to be a quiet room. I wish she hadn't made it seem so frustrating to her and iffy for me. But, it turned out well
The breakfast is very nice especially since it runs until 10am, great if you like to sleep in.
There were ample choices of hot and cold dishes. I appreciated the fresh fruit, including pineapple slices and other sliced fruit. I think the rate, combined with the lovely breakfast really makes staying there appealing.
I used the fitness center, which was small, but adequate. There was no remote control for the TV so I had to do some trial and error on the back of the tv to get it turned on and turned to a channel.
The fitness center is in the basement down a long hallway that is grim. I think there might be rooms on that floor, which would not be appealing to me.
But, the center itself has big windows to the street, so it has a very plesant outlook.
The only REAL negative was the air conditioner in our room, which was loud. I had to turn it off to sleep, but then the room would get hot, so I'd wake up and turn it back on. I did this several times during the night so I didn't get a very good sleep.
This is the only reason I might not return to this hotel when in Seattle again. 
I did like the value and the breakfast and the fitness center though.
The check out team was much more friendly than the check in and I could see they were kind to people about storing luggage.
There is no restaurant in this hotel so we found a brouchure for a pizza delivery in the area and we ordered that since it was late at night when we arrived and we didnt want to roam the streets.This hotel is perfectly situated for getting to events at Seattle Center. We were attending the dinner show at Teatro ZinZanni, which was a very walkable 4 blocks away. Accomodations were clean and the staff extra friendly. The Breakfast was good and the food regularly refreshed by a zealous attendant. My only complaint was the antiseptic odor on the hallways and especially near the elevator (4th floor). I've experienced this in other medium-rate hotels, but here it was especially strong.We chose this hotel because we were going to Key Arena for a concert. Upon arrival they offered us water and when they found out we were going to a concert offered to call us a cab so we didnt have to drive. Everything was clean and great. However when they gave us a pass to park underground they did not mention that there was a fee. The next morning we found a bill under our door. They took it off as we called to complain.
A negative was the noise...you heard a lot of doors slamming and ppl talking throughout the night!Accommodations were clean and comfortable. Hotel is undergoing rennovation, but 1/2 is done and no noise from the work in the other half. Easy walk to the Seattle Center, Space Needle, Gates Foundation and the EMP. A bit of a walk to Pike Place, but you can take the monorail from Seattle Center. Breakfast included, but typical limited buffet. Exercise room is adequate.We have stayed at this Hampton Inn property several times for business and vacation. Wonderful location, close to Seattle Center and Key Arena. So if you're going to the ballet, basketball games, space needle, monorail, EMP (definitely recommend!) then it is super convenient with great amenities. We have even stayed here and taken public transportation to Mariner's and Seahawks games clear across town, and to the Museum of Flight (a great find!). The staff here are super friendly and professional. They make every effort to have your stay be enjoyable! Highly recommend!I used Hampton Inn in Seattle based on the great experience I had using the Hampton Inn in San Jose, Costa Rica. The Hotel is extremely well located, much better than the similar hotels in the same price range. It is close to the Space Needle, Museums, shopping and good restaurants. The hotel is being remodeled and is in tip-top shape. We were not bothered by any of the work going on and it should be complete soon. As is the norm at Hampton Inns, the staff is friendly and polite. My Children loved the breakfast offering which is huge. The Hampton Inn is a great value.Stayed for one night with my 5 year old son on February 18th, 2012. Check in was fast and friendly. Free parking was nice with lots of availability. Appreciated the free Wi-Fi as well. The breakfast buffet was decent as well - not gourmet by any means but not bad for free. 
Stayed on the third floor which was actually at street level on the side of the hotel we were in - did hear street noise at times, but not too bad. The hotel is on a hill, so the floor level compared to the street changes from one side to another. 
Overall a good place to stay within walking disatance to the EMP, Space Needle and the Pacfic Science Center (my son loved the live bug exhibit!)Checked in at 2am after an early flight to beat snowstorm out of Denver. Hotel staff was very attentive and friendly even at that late hour. Breakfast was great, many choices and nice open lobby area to enjoy it in. Free and fast internet in hotel was great. Allowed us to plan our unexpected bonus day in Seattle. We walked three blocks to the Space Needle and enjoyed the SUNNY views from up top. Then took tram into downtown (about 5 minutes) and walked to Pike Place market. Trip back to hotel was quick and easy and free of the congestion downtown. Beds were very comfy, parking was secure. Renovation was complete in the areas we were in. Had to walk through a portion being renovated to get to our car but we did not experience any noise in the hotel. We would definitely come back to this hotel for our next trip to Seattle.Stayed here on business and had a great time. When not working could easily go to the downtown area via the tram and the restaurants around the hotel were very good. A 24-hour grocery store a block away made my life easier, as we ate in our rooms one night. The breakfast was very good and the 24-hour coffee or tea indispensable! I am a very light sleeper but did not hear a thing, no street noise, no thumping! Great choice!Stayed here while on business. Good Internet connections with wireless. Close to Key Arena, Space Needle and various other tourist locations. Quick drive to stadiums if that's what you want for your stay. Staff was excellent even though I checked in early they made my stay tremendous as I was sick at the time. I would stay here again for sure. Lots of restaurants as well within walking distance.It's too bad that the hotel was under renovation, as there were a lot of good things and I can only asume that it will be even better once the construction is finished. The staff was the best part of our stay; they really shown. Everyone from the front desk to the breakfest manager were wonderful, helpful and attentive. The room we had was a nice respite from the construction. Clean and comfortable, with free wi-fi it was what I have come to expect from Hampton Inn. Parking was a problem, several times the limited on-site parking was full. There was no pool, just a small fitness room and a pleseant courtyard that was overrun with smokers. The location is extremely convenient to the Space Needle but requires a car or bus ride to Pikes Place or Safeco. The breakfest was free but (probably because construction had taken over the regular breakfest area) the food was all prepackaged and not what I expected. Overall though, the hotel was a good value and I would certainly come back!We have stayed at this Hampton Inn many times in the past. We have always enjoyed the friendly staff and the clean, comfortable rooms. We primarily choose it for the location, within walking distance of many restaurants and just down the block from the fantastic 500 Mercer QFC. Our most recent stay, however, was very disappointing. The Hampton is in the process of remodeling; while the suite that we typically reserved was cozy and well appointed (fireplace and kitchenette), the updated suite oddly designed, with poor-quality furniture. The bathroom has a dungeon-sized, very heavy and squeaky door, perfect for waking your partner in the middle of the night. The window dressings were a poor fit, leaving city lights streaming into the room at night. The heater was very loud (clunking). An overwhelming, sweet-orange air freshener is now pumped through the ventilation system in the hallways. I hope that this stay was an anomaly during the remodeling phase.Our family has stayed in a number of Hampton Inns in various places, and this one ranks right up there. The staff members were very helpful and accommodating, the breakfast area was large and well maintained, and the hotel is conveniently located. On our last day at the hotel I asked if it would be okay to check out a little late, and the desk person was able to take care of it with no hassle whatsoever. Not only was the breakfast area large, they had a good selection of things to choose from including freshly cut up fruit. Conveniently located means that there were a number of good sounding restaurants within a block or two and two food markets within several blocks. In addition, Pacific Northwest Ballet and a couple of theaters were also within a few blocks while others have mentioned proximity to the Space Needle and that area. 
A couple of potential downsides. The website for the hotel mentions a $15 fee for parking, but I was not charged for parking .... perhaps because I am a Hilton Honors member? Anyway, good news. Our room had a private patio and a nice view of the Space Needle, but the door to the patio had a rather flimsy blind so that a lot of light leaked into the room at night. The heating/air conditioning unit was one that turned on and off all the time to maintain the set temperature; my personal preference is for a unit that runs continuously to provide ""white noise"". Other than that, the room was clean, quiet and comfortable.We booked this hotel after reading other reviews and we were not disappointed. It is located within walking distance to the public market, many restaurants and coffee shops. The rooms were clean and looked recently remodeled. The beds were very comfortable and the breakfast was quite good, featuring eggs, sausage and waffles (along with the standard cereal, oatmeal and more). The eating area was spacious and relaxing. We came to visit a school for my son, and would not hesitate to stay again if he attends school in Seattle. It was a great deal for an urban area!Walking distance to Needle, Pike's Market, downtown bars and clubs, and waterfront path. Great b'fast, rooms, staff and value. All rooms have separate kitchenette and living room area. At front rooms above second floor have spectacular view of the sound.My stay here went very well and it was due to the hotel staff. They helped me with all my questions and provided great restaurant recommendations (all within walking distance). The room condition was good and the bathroom was clean. I would recommend this hotel to potential travelers.
There was one hitch. It is a real stretch for Hampton to call this a ""downtown"" hotel. It is closer to the music experience (over rated) and the Space Needle (still cool). But it is not close to central downtown. It is a very long walk or a short cab ride to downtown from this locationI have stayed here before, during, and after construction, and I must say it's a very nice Hampton after the remodel. It's located downtown, within walking distance of the Seattle Center, but in a quiet area. You'll need a car. The staff is usually friendly. I am a return customer, and I would recommend this hotel to a friend.We were extremely happy with our stay here. It's a quick walk to the Space Needle, the EMP Museum, and the monorail that took us downtown each day. We loved our large suite, with a full kitchen, a small balcony and a gas fireplace that we lit in the morning and at night. The bed was comfortable, and the pillows were just right. Plenty of closet space, too. The hotel layout is strange, though -- we felt like we were walking through a maze to get to the far-off elevator that took us to our room. And the breakfast area is an extremely crowded free-for-all. Good luck finding a spot to sit! Still, the positives far outweighed the inconveniences. We would definitely return.Please note that this review is for a standard King room.
I was reluctant to book at this hotel due to a few recent negative reviews, but the other Hilton branch my husband and I love in Seattle wasn't available. Luckily, we ended up liking it just fine. The hotel isn't fancy, but it is very comfortable. Their staff was friendly, the rooms were clean, and the in-room internet was free. Nothing felt dingy. I can't give feedback on the free breakfast since we didn't get a chance to try it out. 
Parking was a little tight, but easy enough if you have a compact or mid-size rental. I don't know how comfortable I would have been if I had my mini-van with me though. It's helpful to back in to the spots even though the signs say head-in only. Note that there are two parking garages; the main one is on the left closest to the lobby, and a secondary one is to the right on a lower level. The lower level garage doesn't fill up as quickly, so I suggest parking there. Keep in mind that the secondary garage elevator does not go up to the top floor of the hotel, which is the 6th floor. We had to ride it up to the lobby level and take a second elevator to our room. It was a weird set-up, but worth it for easier parking.
Although the name of the hotel says ""Seattle Downtown"", it's really about one mile away from the ""real"" downtown area. We already knew this ahead of time though. It's common sense to map out the distance of the hotel in relation to the places you want to visit prior to booking. 
The hotel is only two or three blocks from the Seattle Center, which was perfect for us since we were dining at the Space Needle and visiting the EMP Museum. There was a cool little Indie music store across from our room called Silver Platters that was fun to browse in. We also found a really nice 24-hour grocery across the street called QFC. (The office-like building didn't look like there'd be a market in it.) They had a Starbucks in the QFC as well, so that was super convenient.
We drove downtown a few times for dinner, but in hindsight should have walked the mile there or taken a taxi since parking in the ""real"" downtown is really inconvenient and expensive. I am glad we paid for parking when we went to Pike Place though. It was nice having the car to store the stuff we bought.My wife and I had to make an emergency trip to be with a son who had brain surgery. we arrived on November 18th and found Laimara at the desk. In the course of checking us in she asked what brought us to Seattle. We explained the emergency that brought us here. She was very sympathetic and didn't charge us for the parking, to help us out. The room was very comfortable and quiet (fifth floor). She told us about a grocery store which was very close and also a resturant. The location was great, being only about a mile from Harborview Hospital. The hot breakfast was a real treat and the the setting area was adequate. Everyone was so helpful!!This hotel need a lot of work, rooms are wear off, not that clean, location is decent but Hotel old need revampingWe stayed at this hotel the night before leaving on our Alaskan cruise. The hotel is exactly what you expect from Hampton Inn, clean, comfy, and cozy with a good breakfast. The hotel is in a great location. We walked to the Space Needle and Chihuly Glass Museum, and we took the monorail to it's only stop which dropped us off 3 blocks from Pike's Market! 
The hotel offered a shuttle to the cruise docks for a very reasonable fair. We might have saved a few dollars by taking a cab since there were 4 of us, but we opted for the convenience of the shuttle.We stayed 3 nights and found the location really good for what we wanted. Obviously it was going through renovations and wasn't up to 100 per cent. We were ""upgraded"" to a suite but when we got into the room there were a couple things lacking. There were no towel racks in bathroom or any counter space to put your toiletry bags, no place to sit other than bed and desk. No coffee pot. The staff was super friendly and the breakfast was great. Close to Seattle Center, monorail, restarurants. Nice quiet neighborhood. Will stay again.Overall a good place to stay if you are doing stuff in around the downtown area of seattle. Little in the way of added amenities (e.g. no pool). It really is more for the business person and not families. Location wise good for being close restaurants, and shops and stuff.We just returned from a trip to Seattle and loved the location of this great hotel. The hotel was fully booked during our stay however, the staff did everything they could to accomodate the guests I encountered while waiting in line at the front desk. We unfortunately had a problem with the A/C in our room and they attempted to resolve our issue by sending a repairman up immediately, however his repair was not enough to completely fix the problem, so they stood by their hotel policy and adjusted our bill. We were satisfied with their earnest attempts to resolve the issue and we felt we were treated as valued guests. 
The hotel was very clean and the rooms were nicely appointed. The complimentary breakfast was more than enough food and the staff handled the large crowd very well. The hotel also had complimentary coffee, teas and flavored water available 24 hours/day and offered a fresh baked cookies at various times throughout the day. The elevators were efficient and handled the traffic well on fully booked nights. The laundry facilities were not all in working order but we were able to locate other machines on another floor and were able to wash a load of clothing that had been soiled by the weather. This was very convenient, as was the QFC grocery store across the street from the Hampton Inn. 
The hotel was located in a neighborhood with a safe feeling and many great restaurants within a short 1 to 5 block walk from the property. The front desk staff was very good with their recommendations for dining in the area. They did not steer us wrong with any of their suggestions. The staff was also knowledgeable about the public transportation available to many area attractions, which was a great money saver. In addition, they were courteous enough to arrange our transport to the cruise terminal for our ship at Pier 91. 
If we return to the Seattle area, we would feel very at home staying at the Hampton Inn again. Kudos to a very professional staff, who did everything they could to make our stay comfortable.This Hampton is convenient to the Space Needle, museums and downtown. One morning, we hiked up Queen Anne (a few blocks away) for an excellent view of downtown Seattle and the islands. Several good restaurants and shopping are also within a few blocks walk. The hotel is probably in need of an update, but is perfectly adequate. They were able to handle a crowd at breakfast with two large cruise groups at the hotel during our stay. The front office staff was friendly and helpful. Parking in the garage is a bit tight (and costs $15/day), but we did not use the car much in the city.This was a perfect location for our trip to Seattle. Within close walking distance of the Seattle Center (Space Needle, Chihuly Glass and Gardens and Monorail). I like Hampton Inn's as I find them very comfortable. However, I had not realized I had booked a suite and had a very pleasant surprise when I opened the door. The suite was as big as my first apartment and that is no exaggeration. Gas fireplace, sofa bed, patio, full kitchen with dinner ware for 4, full size refrigerator. We were travelling with another couple so our ""living room"" was very cozy for visiting in front of the fire after our days out. For $166 a night, this was a deal! There is a very nice grocery store across the street (QFC, part of the Kroger family so I could even use my Kroger card) so if you want to buy food to keep in your room very nice. The NY Pizza and Bar is also across the street and we had a very nice dinner there one evening. The parking was a bit expensive @ $15/ night but then where is parking not expensive. However, it was left off our bill so when I mentioned it, the lady at the front desk said, oh, don't worry about it. Thanks so much! Hotel also has a nice workout room.Very convenient to the Space Needle and downtown. The hotel itself is old and tired. If the location works for you then this hotel might be a good choice. But I have to think there are better options at this price point.This hotel is conveniently located in downtown Seattle, very close to main attractions such as the Space Needle, the Exerience Music Project (very cool for music or guitar lovers), the Chihuly Glass art exhibit (great even for someone not into art), and a short hike to Pike Place. We even walked to and from Safeco Field, though that was probably as far as I'd want to walk. If you can't walk, then it would be a short cab ride that they'd be happy to call for you.
That leads me to the overall service, and I will say it was excellent. Reggie checked us in, took all of our bags into holding, set us up with an airport ride, and he'd our bags again. Now, that sounds like service that could be expected, but it was the ""my pleasure, no trouble"" attitude that made the stay great.
The breakfast was fine, the rooms were fine, and the beds were comfy. It is a modest hotel, not 5-star accommodations. It's a great value in a great location with great service.The lack of respect afterward was very disheartening. Upon learning I had left my Kindle in the room, I called immediately, same day. I was told the Kindle was not turned in. I was told in a very patronizing manner that ""the housekeeping did not steal it maam.""
I am absolutely positive that I left it in there as my bag wen directly from my room to the trunk of my car for the remainder of my trip. So my only conclusion (Other than a theft) is the housekeeping did a horrible job in cleaning (black case on a white bedspread) and now the occupant of the room has a new Kindle. 
Lesson learned and will never stay there again.Our family of 4 had a nice time at this hotel. Staff is friendly and service oriented. Rooms nice and clean. Best of all located 2 blocks from city center and lots of great restaurants within walking distance too. Stay here. Well with it.Just completed a 3-day stay on points at this location. Since it was a reward stay, perhaps I shouldn't be too salty, but then again, I was charged a whopping 190,000 HHonors points for a two-room suite, so I guess I'm entitled to a negative opinion of this place. Since my complaints are numerous, I will just list them bullet style.
-- Location - this place is NOT downtown as it is called in the marketing of the hotel Why not call it Hampon Inn Seattle Center? It is two blocks north of the Space Needle, so I guess if you're doing that while you're in town you will have a short walk. But to get downtown you have to take the Seattle Center monorail or a cab. Poor marketing on location here, folks. 
-- Noise - The construction at the actual hotel may be completed, but the surrounding construction noise early Monday morning was atrocious. We were awakened EARLY by the sound of jackhammers, dump trucks, loud crashes, etc.. There is a ton of construction/destruction going on one block east and north of the hotel. Of course my room was facing this mess. Not only is it an eyesore, but when you're on a mini-vaction and you want to catch some much needed sleep, you can forget about it (at least on one side of the hotel).
-- Disgusting bath tub - At first glance, the suite was impressive. Spacious, full kitchen, nice gas fireplace, good sized bathroom. Then I pulled the shower curtain back and took one look at the tub and just shook my head (see attached photo). Not only did the porcelain have a quarter sized hole in it near the rear of the tub, but as you can see the entire tub had this HUGE grey stain from where a previous tub mat had been left too long and collected mold/mildew. Instead of replacing this tub, they just leave it be for guest after guest to walk in and say, ""YUCK!""?? That just boggles the mind. 
-- Heating/AC - Alright... so it's nearing winter time in Seattle. Which means, damp, cold, mid 40's for highs every day. So I was looking forward to this fireplace thing. But the fireplace is not on a thermostat at all. It's on some stupid 5 minute timer. So on consecutive cold nights while watching TV in the living room and trying to enjoy the fireplace, you have to get up every 5 minutes and wind up the stupid timer? Please. On top of that, the separate bedrooms don't seem to have temperature control. Instead, they have this goofy looking old 1970's style wall mounted heat/AC unit. I hate to break the news to the property managers here, but as a Hilton Diamond who has over 500 nights on the road in the last 5 years, your hotel is the FIRST to offer such horrendous in room air conditioning units.
-- Parking - So, I will give the hotel props for waiving my $8 daily parking fee for Diamonds. But I must say this - why charge for parking at all? There isn't a big demand for parking in this area is there? It's not like you're DOWNTOWN. And the parking? What a bizarre setup. The limited outside spaces are so narrow you can forget trying to get a full sized car in them. Then with the hotel built onto a hill there are two different parking garage entrances. But get this - the garages aren't hooked together. So once you do get parked and find an elevator things get extremely confusing. Oh, and the spaces in side the garage? Even tighter than the ones outside. Absoultely ridiculous parking situation at this hotel to say the least.
-- Housekeeping - can someone please explain to me why one day the maids would clean the condo thoroughly including replacing the towels and then the next day they barely touched the place and did not bother replacing the wet wash cloths or towels that were purposely left in the tub to be replaced? Mind boggling.
Staff - I have no complaints about the staff at all. The girls at the front desk are all very helpful and pleasant, as are the attendants working the breakfast area. Service here is probably the only high mark I can give.
Breakfast - Typical Hampton Inn breakfast. Nuked powdered egges, Nuked greasy sausage. The line for the waffle maker was a mile long both mornings we ate here. Cereals/muffins/fruit/yogurt was well stocked and fresh.
If I had it to do over again, I would have just paid to stay downtown instead of wasting a huge amount of HHonors points on this disappointing stay.We stayed 2 nights on 30th October, 2011 as we were attending a concert at McCaw Hall. The hotel is an easy 5 minute walk away. There are good restaurants and coffee bars nearby. We upgraded to a suite which was perfectly adequate although cheaply furnished. They have gated underground parking for $15.00 a night.We stayed at this Hampton Inn two nights, October 30-31, 2011. Our room was well-appointed and comfortable. We were on the fourth floor, and it was pleasantly quiet.
The location is ideally located close to a number of restaurants, as well as being just one block away from Seattle Center and McCaw Hall, where we were attending a concert. We felt very safe walking back to the hotel from the Hall. In fact, we left our car in the secure parking garage the entire time we were there, and walked everywhere. 
The buffet breakfast was well-appointed, and the staff was diligent in not letting the food run out. 
We will definitely stay there again when we visit Seattle.Excellent location (see my review of the nearby Crow restaurant). Only a few blocks from the space needle. Traffic a bit of an issue due to construction, but I assume this is temporary.
Staff very welcoming. The rooms were very nice and clean. Amenities are as expected. We had a nice view of the space needle.
Parking is problematic. There is a $15 daily charge and the spaces are all made for compact vehicles. Don't even think of parking in the garage. We saw one guy back right into a post as there is very little space to maneuver a vehicle. 
I would stay here again, but would explore off-site parking lots.After a long road trip and still having to travel to get to my destination, I stopped at the Hampton Inn for one night to get my energy back. This is yet another good chain of hotels. We were given covered, locked parking and were allowed to leave the car for hours after check out. The breakfast was fine, this hotel is right near the Space Needle, Convention Hall and rock and roll museum. It is possible to walk downtown, take the bus, monorail or $8 taxi ride.
Seattle hotels are not cheap, this was one of the most reasonable ones in the area.We stayed two nights at the Hampton Inn and Suites in Downtown Seattle. Although our room was an 'Inn' so standard size, the bathroom was nice and the shower was great. Their complimentary breakfast is terrific . . . omlets one day and scrambled eggs and sausage the other and they have coffee and hot water for tea or hot cocoa 24/7. And we loved the fresh baked cookies in the evening. Fitness room has a treadmill, bike, stairclimber and eliptical which worked for us. Location is just five minutes from downtown. Definitely recommend it!This hotel is in excellent shape. The renovations are finished and the final product is nice and comfortable. We found the room spacious and everything was clean. The breakfast was good and the employees friendly (even with a 6 am maintenance call because I couldnt get the hairdryer to work which turned out to be operator error.)
The only bad thing about this hotel is the location, granted its actually affordable so I would stay again, but the ""Downtown"" part is misguided. It is a quick walk to the monorail which will take you downtown but it is not in downtown Seattle.I read reviews before I stayed there. I was worried about construction noise after reading some reviews so I called hotel 1 week before I stayed there. They said 1 side of the property has done renovating and lobby area is also done. So I requested renovated room and I got it and it was very comfortable room. However I noticed that you can easily hear noises from hallway to your room. But I don't think hotel can do anything. You just have to have luck not to have noisy guest staying in your floor!!
All the staff I met was friendly and professional. I wanted to note that James who I discovered later that he is general manager of this hotel was very helpful and caring. I was walking sidewalk right by this hotel and there was glitch on the sidewalk and I fell really bad on the ground. When I came back to the hotel, he came out from the front desk and said ""Are you alright??"". I was surprised to find out that he knew I fell because where I fell could not be seen from front desk area.
Then he told me that his office's window faces to that sidewalk and he saw whole things!! i was very very embarrassed!! Not knowing he was general manager but he immediately got first aid kit for my wound on palms and gave me cookie to cheer. he reassured me and made me so comfortable.
I work for the big resort in Hawaii but never saw any general manager work this hard and caring and personal. Usually they would tell people what to do and they would not do anything on their own, So I was really impressed!!
Thank you, James! After 2 weeks, finally my wound closed up and healed.
When I stayed there again, I would definitely stop by and say hello to you! Mahalo!The hotel is undergoing a lobby upgrade. Construction was present, but quiet. The rooms are freshly remodeled. Breakfast was good, above normal Hampton standard. Location is right great being right next to the Seattle Center and walking distance to downtown.The hotel is currently under construction. We only stayed 1 night, on a Sunday, so we were not disturbed by it. I chose this location because we were having dinner at the Space Needle, and heading to the airport Monday morning. It was a very easy walk to the Space Needle and the drive to airport was against rush hour traffic, so it took less than a 1/2 hour. 
The breakfast was different than the other Hampton's I have stayed at. You had to heat the food yourself, but we didn't mind. We took the food to our room and used the microwave there. 
The room was well equipped. Frig, microwave, sink.
Overall, it was what I expected from a Hampton Inn. I use the chain frequently.
Hhonors Gold MemberThere are renovations going on at the main building at this Hampton Inn. Main lobby is now on the lower level. Getting to the upper rooms is through a maze of hallways and 2 separate elevators. Avoid the rooms in the main building on the 5th street side. noise from traffic and construction = not good.
The advertized complimentary hot breakfast is NOT hot. It is all prepackaged and cold and awful. packaged eggs, packaged bagels.... yuck.
The air-conditioner in the bedroom is noisy and temperature not easily controlled and there was no free newspaper for my room.
The location is convenient if you want to be close to the Space Needle or to Seattle Center. There are public buses to get you downtown/ Pikes Place Market if you know which bus and the schedule. Otherwise it's about a 2 1/2 mile walk.
There are restaurants close by and a 24 hr grocery store across the street.
I would've have opted for another hotel if I'd known about the construction and NOT HOT packaged in plastic complimentary breakfast.this location is tops...walking distance to space needle and to the 'ducks'...rooms were spacious and the front desk staff was excellent.....after leaving the hotel for a trip to victoria, i discovered that i had left my ipad charger...i called the hotel and it was waiting for me when i returned...There is construction at this hotel so it was a bit cumbersome to get to our room. The room was great the the bed was comfortable. Good selection for breakfast that was included in the price, so this saved by not having to eat out.I've been here a few times on business.. its always been enjoyable to stay in this hotel. The staff are very welcoming and make you feel at home. There is a free breakfast every morning with a free copy of the newspaper.
I've used both the suites (one bedroom) and rooms. Both of which are spacious & comfortable. I think some of these are a little dated, but I can see some of the rooms are being renovated.
Although the hotel isn't very close to downtown district, it is serviced by buses and the monorail which will get you downtown. Also a 20 minute walk will get you there.
There is a place to access email & internet and print items if you wish. WiFi is available in the hotel along with wired internet access points in each room.Stayed here with friends and loved the location. The room was spacious and clean. The weather was not very nice, but we enjoyed our stay. I would stay here again.While I would love to give the hotel a pass because of the construction, I am hard-pressed to do so because of the 209.00 a night they were charging despite the construction. 
Check in was very straight forward, however the lobby is very very small because of the on going construction and its basically a counter and a coffee machine with a wall of plywood opposite. 
I had a rental car and I was told to park down the street and basically the parking lot of a retail complex, upon my return I made sure I had understood the location properly to which I was told ""as long as you are in a numbered spot you are fine"" which of course would have been useful when I asked the first time. 
Aside from the trek down the street, the rooms were typical Hampton Inn, 
The internet speed was excellent, and the bed was soft with the room being clean. 
You can't argue with the location as the Space Needle was 10 minutes down the street; however aside from that there isn't too much around (especially in the evening) to keep you busy if you happen to check in early evening. 
Its not really downtown in the traditional downtown core sense of the word, but that is another story all together. 
The buffet breakfast was another victim of the construction blues; 
It was served in what I assumed was a conference room, and the seating was very limited with very little space to navigate returning to your table with a bowl of cereal. 
My understanding was it was a temporary location till construction was finished, however certainly worth baring in mind as there few alternatives for breakfast in the area. 
I am sure once the construction is finished it will be more of a conventional Hampton, however till it is you will have some issues staying there.For the most part, we got precisely what we expected. Location was great, the rooms was clean (although the decor was a bit dated), breakfast was not what we expected due to renovations on the hotel breakfast area. Clearly the hotel is a bit dated and that is being addressed through renovation. Overall, staff and management are doing an excellent job managing their hotel operation during the renovation and we were pleased with our stay. I look forward to visiting again once renovation is complete.The hotel has recently been renovated and everything is new. We especially liked the shower: great water pressure, hand shower attachment, and all brand new. The only weird thing is that there is no closet! In looking for a closet, I accidentally opened the door to the adjoining room which means there's no security between the rooms. No hangers, no iron as stated. As others have pointed out, the layout is a little expansive as well -- the gym is on the other side of the hotel -- a far walk involving multiple elevators. The gym itself has no weights, only cardio so we didn't use it anyway and ran in the city.We were in Seattle for 2 nights. This Hotel was a run of the mill, standard city centre major chain establishment, perfectly acceptable and clean. It's major advantage is its' location within 5 minutes walk of the Space Needle and monorail station. Breakfast was pretty good continental style buffet. We would probably try a different Hotel if in Seattle again, just to try somewhere different, but absolutely no complaints about this one.I love Hampton Inns. They are always in a location I need and have everything I need in a hotel. This one was no exception. Yes they are renovationing the hotel, but we had no issues during our stay. You cannot beat the location of the hotel. It is definitely walking distance to the Space Needle. The front desk was also very helpful. We had a dinner cruise booked, and it is so hard to drive in Seattle (even the cab driver laughed when we told him we were using the GPS in our phones) but the front desk told us how cheap it was to take a cab, and was sorry their shuttle didn't run that late because they would have taken us. The breakfast was not the typical Hampton breakfast because of the renovation, but they had ham, egg, and cheese muffin sandwiches you just heat up in the microwave, and they got us going. My only complaint would be that they only had 1 microwave, but I am on vacation and not in a hurry anyways. I definitely would stay here again.My husband and I stayed at this location for two nights after traveling to other areas of WA. Yes, there is a lot of construction going on, but it really didn't bother us. The breakfast area had been moved to a large room down the hall as they are in the process of expanding the regular breakfast area. It looked to me as if they were just about completed with the work. Great location, comfortable clean room, and really good location. If anything, request a room that doesn't face the street as the street traffic at night and morning was a little loud. There are an ample number of interior rooms available.I always book on line and there was never a mention on any of the home pages for this hotel (hamptoninnseattle.com or http://hamptoninn.hilton.com) that construction was in progress. Guests considering staying at any property - regardless of brand - should be aware in advance so they can make an informed decision about booking or going elsewhere. The impact: construction noise overhead our suite and lobby area, no lobby to retreat to when housekeeping calls, change in breakfast (no hot items) and jammed parking. Again, if you are OK with this fine but be aware.
Having said that, our suite was very nice, super clean and well laid out. We liked it a lot. It even had a balcony albeit overlooking the street. But they should have a dead bolt installed on the glass balcony door especially as it opens right on to street level. The only lock is the push button within the knob.
Staff was very engaging, saying 'hi' to guests all the time and holding the elevator for guests. As other posters have noted, location is great - within walking distance to the Space Needle, Key Arena and a few nice restaurants- but right next to several busy streets with all its traffic noise. It dies down after dark but again be aware. I suspect there's a charge for parking but again I didn't see that noted on the above referenced web sites but maybe I missed it.
Still, I recommend this hotel. I'm sure it's ideal especially after construction goes away.Nice Hampton in an eclectic neighborhood with great small restaurants and pubs. Walk to the Space Needle, Key Center and theater.
Well run hotel with a wonderful staff.
I had a suite which ranked with Hamptons best.
Well staffed breakfast area that was clean, friendly and well supplied.
The only complaint is the noise factor from the hallways and street. The walls are not well insulated but this is a small drawback from an otherwise great smaller Hampton Inn.Hampton Inns provide predictable amenities and services and this one is no different. Can't complain on that count at all. But this property is an older construction, seems to be woodframe construction not concrete, and from our room we could hear every squeaky footstep from the inhabitants above. Not conducive to good sleep! Parking garage is only 6' clearance and there are limited spots outside for SUVs.This hotel is all about the great location. The hotel itself is a horrifying maze & the underground parking is really tight, park in the outdoor lot if possible. Rooms were clean, bed was really comfortable. Stayed in a King Suite, had a full kitchen. Only real complaint was we did not get maid service until almost 5:00 p.m.
The hotel is under pretty massive construction in areas. We were not bothered by it where our room was located. Request to be far away from it, lots of new carpet smells and dust.The room was very clean and spacious. Price was more then what I expected for a Hampton inn..(it's the area).. . the monorail is about two blocks to take you to convention center and the needle and music is right there. No Pool. Did have a fitness center. Bed was very comfortable. The Breakfast was typical Hampton Inn. no surprises. I like the waffles. coffee was good. Hey your in Seattle!!! Coffee Houses galore. 
Staff was very nice and front desk very accommodating. The parking was cramp. and you have to pay$$ all in all it was a good experience.Booked this hotel as it is just outside of downtown, convenient to the freeway, and close to everything we wanted to do, yet priced about $50 less than everything else just a few blocks away. It was a good value, even with the $13 parking fee per day.
This was a typical Hampton with clean rooms, business center, free wireless internet, free breakfast, etc. The underground parking garage is a little tight, but we found that throughout Seattle.This hotel is great for business travelers. The accomodations are spacious and comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located to restaurants, coffee shops, and even a full service supermarket. less than 2 blocks from the Space Needle. The front desk staff is friendly had incorrect information about area attractions on two occasions. The complimentary continental breakfast was really nice.My wife and I booked a suite at this location for our 9-day trip to Seattle the first week of October. Our suite was incredible, with a balcony view of the Space needle and downtown Seattle, a fireplace, and full kitchen. The room was superbly clean and in full repair, and was quickly cleaned and made up every day. They even cleaned our dishes! (the kitchen was stocked with a few settings and basic pots/pans).
There is a grocery store directly across the street as well, so it was easy to stock up and take a few meals in our room to save some money and fatigue of eating out every day.
If you do want to eat out however, there are literally dozens of choices within walking distance of the hotel. (mostly Asian though. If you like Sushi or Thai, you'll be in heaven)
The location is also within walking distance of Seattle Center, the Space Needle, EMP/SciFi Museum, etc. 
We rented a car for the trip so never tried out public transportation from the hotel.
The hotel itself is very nice, though from our room it was quite a hike to the front office. It was actually quicker to exit the building and walk across the parking lot outside to breakfast, etc than weave your way through the halls and dodge the cleaning carts and children in the halls around the regular rooms.
The breakfast room was incredibly busy and crowded on the weekends (we had to take a tray back to the room so we could sit) but the fare was nice. Yes, they have a waffle maker! Weekdays it was fine and plenty of seating available.
My only gripe is parking - though they do have parking, I found nothing beforehand informing me that it was an additional $13/day to park! I found this odd since it is really not ""downtown"" and they have several covered garages and outdoor parking. it's not like they're hurting for space so this is just another money grab, IMO. 
If you do have a car, and do park there, be warned, the spots are TIGHT. We rented a Ford Focus and on many evenings I'd have to let my wife out before parking as there was no way to squeeze into a spot with enough room for doors to open on both sides. People staying there with huge SUV's or sedans often blocked 2 spaces, or stuck out nearly blocking access to garage entrances.
Otherwise, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and we loved our stay.I did a lot of research to find the best hotel for our trip to Seattle and changed reservations several times before settling on this hotel. I was extremely pleased with my final selection. The hotel itself is within two blocks of the Space Needle and our room had a fabulous view of it. We stayed in a suite room that was very roomy and had a full kitchen. I had read a comment that the hotel was difficult to find but we had no difficulty finding the hotel. The hotel has a few parking spaces outside but the majority of the parking is in a garage. The cost of parking is reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. We had no trouble obtaining reasonable transportation downtown and to all the sightseeing areas. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Seattle.We stayed at this hotel prior to a Cruise to Alaska out of the port in Seattle. We checked in farily late, but there were still two staff members working at the front desk. The ladies were very kind and we had a smooth check in. The hotel was full, but it was very quiet overnight. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The breakfast area was VERY busy in the morning and it seemed impossible for the staff to keep up with bringing out the food, but the comfort and location made that seem very unimportant. The hotel was within walking distance to the space needle and the tram that takes you across town. All in all, I felt this was a very good value.Stayed here with family for the July 4th long weekend. Our first visit to Seattle. I had requested for early check in and when we got there around noon the room was ready! Room was not very large but clean and served the purpose. No complaints about location, it is about a mile from downtown and the monorail ride is an attraction in itself. Lake union, waterfront and of course the needle are well within walking distance. Front desk was always friendly and helpful, got us a good deal on return to airport.
The only thing that needs improvement is breakfast. Bread, bagel and muffins were all rather tasteless. Ditto scrambled eggs. I have stayed at Hampton Inn JFK airport and they had better stuff. Waffle makers are a nuisance and should be discontinued. More fresh fruits, better eggs, cheese and some dry fruits will earn them full 5 stars!Hotel was clean, nice room, good service. Quite a walk from downtown, such as Pike Place Market. Close to Space Needle and monorail which is $2 roundtrip to downtown. Nice residential area nearby, Queen Anne Hill. Make your way to Kerry Park, great views of the city, but quite a hike up the hills if you do not have a car, but worth it!We are on a road trip honey moon...Seattle was our ""last must stop"" before we headed back to Cali. We wanted to book a regular room, but ended up with a suite. Oh my gosh! it was an awesome suite. Full kitchen, huge TV room, TWO NICE bedrooms and a few blocks from the space needle. The night before we stayed at the Sheraton...doesn't even compare! Continental breakfast that I am so looking forward to in th AM. Something the Sheraton doesn't even compare too. Not to mention they have AAA discount and/or Government, another perk the Sheraton didn't have...This hotel was perfect for the trip we planned. The hotel was very clean, the staff was very helpful and everyone we encountered was very nice. The King suite room with kitchenett was perfect size with a tv in each room. You could walk to the Space Needle (which is where you can get the monorail in to down town) and to many great restaurants. My husband and I felt very confortable walking around in the evening to different restaurants. After spending some time in the actual city area I was thrilled to be back at our hotel. I would recommend this hotel for anyone, and will stay there again when I go back.My husband and I usually love the Hampton Inn, so when we were going to Seattle, my husband booked us at the Hampton Inn and Suites Seattle Downtown. We were very disappointed. First of all, it is not located in downtown Seattle, but outside the downtown, right by the Space Needle. The room we were given had a horrible stale cigarette smell, and you could hear peoples footsteps above your head. The night manager said only one other room was available, so we swithced. The new room was adequate. To us, not as nice as other Hampton Inns. The bathroom and carpet looked tired. The bathroom also was noticeable cold, and therefore very uncomfortable. We had to pay $15 a night parking, and there was no room in the garage. Even if there was room, the spaces were so tight you could barely fit a car in it . We ended up leaving our car in their open lot. We did a load of laundry, and it took my husband three hours to dry our clothes, as the dryer wasn't working well. As for location, I would have rather been located somewhere central in downtown Seattle. I would say that the staff seemed very nice. If I was coming back to Seattle I would definitely choose a hotel more in a neighborhood with shopping and restaurants. I was not happy with this Hampton.Most hotels in any busy downtown areas, especially those near tourist attractions, tend to be rather expensive. This Hampton Inn just north of the Seattle Center offers comfortable amenities in a somewhat secluded neighborhood just a stone's throw away from the attractions of Seattle Center (Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, Experience Music Project), and a monorail ride to the Pike Place market without breaking your wallet.
Offerings include complimentary breakfast, wireless Internet, and three small garages for parking. The layout of the hotel is somewhat confusing, with hallways that twist and turn in seemingly random directions.
The fitness center consists only of aerobic-exercise equipment (stationary bike, recumbent bike, treadmill, elliptical). No resistance machines or free-weights are available. This hotel does not have a pool.
Two PCs are available for use in the main lobby.
Overall, this is a good location away from the hubbub of downtown Seattle, but still in a location convenient to highway access and some sightseeing. Downtown is accessible by the Seattle Center monorail, running from Seattle Center to the Westlake shopping center.I stayed here for 5 nights on a business trip. Check-in was quick and easy. Room was comfortable and well-appointed. Bed was very comfortable and wi-fi was relatively fast.
My only issue was that I could hear every movement of the person in the room above me, whether he/she was walking across the floor or shutting a dresser drawer, I heard it. I know this is common in cheaper hotels like Days Inn and Super 8's, but should not be an issue at ANY Hilton property.
Breakfast was ok, the western omelettes were tasty, but hotels should NEVER serve biscuits with sausage gravy. What a horribly anti-healthy and disgusting breakfast item!!!Went to Seattle over the Christmas holiday for a weekend getaway. Booked at the Hampton Inn Downtown because my husband and I have had great experiences staying at Hampton Inn properties. As expected, this one did not disappoint. The hotel is a short walk from the Space Needle and Seattle Center and within walking distance to downtown, albeit about a 30 minute walk. If heading downtown and you don't want to walk, you can take the bus located right out in front of the hotel. Be advised that this hotel is not located downtown. 
 We got a great rate, $89/night. Our king bedroom was large, clean, had a large tv and very comfortable bed. Breakfast had a great variety of foods (a hot dish, bagels/bread, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal) and something to please everyone. The lobby had 2 computers with internet access that were free to use. The hotel was very quiet in terms of city noise, no horns honking or general commotion, though we did hear footsteps and movement in the room above us but this wasn't too disruptive. The front desk staff wasn't as informed about how to navigate the city and I would have expected but we still managed to get around with no problems. Overall, great value for the money and I would definitely stay again.The only hitch with this establishment was getting there by cab. It is in fact Queen Anne district, and that is very nice even for enjoyable uphill conditionals. The Inn is a stone's throw away from the Space Needle, which is a good point especially for first-time visitors, with the advantage of being able to hop on the once-so-futuristic monorail train and zip to the real downtown in a couple of minutes. Literally, which means the fare of $2 works out at a dollar per minute from every passenger - a nice little earner, methinks. Worth the ride, though, and views along the way, too. In the end we used it almost exclusively to make the transfers.
This Hampton is simply good and unpretentious, guests staying here being both visitors and businessmen. It is well run, and the reception desk staff could not be more helpful, including the greeter at breakfast time. It just cheered things up for all, and having the usual Hampton offering here was actually a pleasant experience. It felt good to read the paper, unrushed and sipping yet another cup of coffee.
Although the spacious room was facing the street, it was perfectly quiet day and night, with comfortable beds. Since there is no pretense at being a hotel, coin-operated washing machine is made available to guests, which is helpful. There is a very good supermarket just a few steps away (QFC) and local bus routes have stops nearby. Best to walk around a bit, though, perhaps across the road and browse the CD store with a huge choice of items (purchases were made). There are some attractively marginal cafes up the hill.I am a FIRM believer in Hampton Inn's and try and travel as much with them. This was the first time I've been charged for parking, which from what I can gather, is the norm across Seattle, but was not overly impressed with it here. Maybe my Silver VIP status would have had it wiped off, but I guess not. If you are not comfortable with tight parking garages, then you might have to take your chances parking in the street. Bfast was good, great staff working here. Nice city view from our room as well!My husband and I were on our honeymoon, and this was a great hotel! It was very clean, very modern, the hotel front desk employees were great and the maintenance staff was very good. 
The location is great, you are only a couple of blocks away from the space needle. It was about a 5 minute walk to the space needle. There we could pick up the monorail and head towards downtown. 
The hotel was very quiet, and the bed was fantastic! We definitely look forward to staying here again when we return to Seattle!First time at this facility, and I was very impressed. Before anything else, I have to mention the front desk folks -- they were fantastic! I have never seen such a combination of cool, professional competence and warm, friendly attitude. Really, I just can't praise them highly enough.
We had a suite, and the one complaint I have is that the a/c unit was in the bedroom section, so it was quite difficult to control the temperature in the living room/kitchen section when connecting door was closed. That's a problem, but not really a major one.
The place was clean and quiet. Everything you could want was provided. There is a fantastic upscale supermarket a very short block away, which even includes a Starbucks inside it. 
The location is great, a short walk from the Space Needle.Stayed here with my spouse and another couple for a football game. We had a 2 bedroom suite. It was perfect for us. There is a a grocery store quite close. The place was clean and comfortable. The bed was also comfortable. Staff friendly and accomodating. The price great for a suite in downtownish Seattle. The only thing that was strange was no A/C in main living room. In the bedrooms only and it got a little warm. The bedroom A/C was loud but drown out other noise.We travel quite often as a family and my spouse travels on business weekly.
We have stayed in many Hampton Inns in the Pacific Northwest and this is why we felt it would be a good choice in Seattle. Boy were we wrong!!! 
We had reserved 2 rooms 1- king and 1 with 2 queens
The king had a portable AC unit that was so noisy you couldn't sleep with it on and it was too warm to sleep with it off. On the second morning I had to hunt for the coffee pot they had put it in the dishwasher-- so not terrible but annoying.
When our kids went to check into room 2 at 4pm they were told that their room wasn't ready so they were given another room. Not 2 queens but a king and a sofa bed, not the best for an adult but we weren't gong to make a big dead out of it. Their unit also had a portable AC unit but it wasn't hooked up called the front desk they sent someone up they hooked it up but left the window above it open when asked how they were going to close it off they were told pull the curtain. so much for efficient use 
Then they opened a drawer in a dresser and discovered it was full of someone elses clothes!!!! Now how well was the rest of the room cleaned when they hadn't even checked the drawers..
Over all for rooms at $220 a night we were very disappointed. They did refund 1 night but it still didn't make up for the experience .We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in August for vacation. It was very typical of most Hampton Inns. That is a good thing. The rooms and property are well kept and comfortable and the breakfast is as expected...hot home made waffles, a few hot items, and breads, muffins, fruit, cereal, etc. The breakfast room was crowded but they provided a meeting room for additional seating. The location is excellent for Seattle Center tourist attractions and we drove downtown in less than 15 minutes. It is also about 5 minutes from the I-5 freeway so it is easy to get out of town & explore. They do charge extra for parking, but parking in Seattle is ridiculous everywhere.We stayed here for 5 nights in a 1 bedroom King Suite. Really expected more from the reviews. The room, while being a nice size was dirty and unappealing. The decor is probably 7-8 years old and looks it. Sofa has stains on the arms. Ceiling must have had some stains on it which were painted over in paint that did not match. Holes in the walls were poorly patched. 
Location is nice.. coming from the airport we took the light rail line to downtown, then the monorail to Seattle Center.. from there it is just 2 blocks.
Breakfast was ok.. the usual high-fat, high-carb items but I guess that's what most people eat.
I really wanted to like this place, and paying for a suite we certainly expected something a little more luxurious. Felt more like a cheap, run down apartment. Staff was very friendly though.
Fitness center is tiny and had rather outdated equipment. Internet access, both wired and wireless, was extremely slow as others have stated.Location OK but too many rooms for the size of the breakfast area. We ended up at Denny's. Can be a bit noisy.We sent 2 days at the Hampton before we left on our cruise. The hotel was very close to the Space needle, which we walked to each day. The breakfast in the morning is great along with the afternoon cookies at the front desk. The front desk will give you a bottle of water if you ask before setting out for the day. First time we stayed here we were on the 6th floor, which we liked as it was very quiet. On our return we stayed on the 4th floor and that was near the main street which was noisy. Free internet was nice, no pool, fitness center is small but adequate. Grocery store close by which is huge, we purchased beer and goodies for our room.Wrote a long review and lost it so here's the shorter version-
great view of Space Needle, great staff, the housekeeping staff even load and run the dishwasher for you, there's washer dryer rooms, at least one available on every floor ($1 a wash), free coffee, tea and hot chocolate 24/7 in lobby to take with you, $100 a night cheaper than the other hotels we liked, great location for tourists, 6ft bed very comfy, did I mention it was spotlessly clean? We don't usually leave much of a tip for housekeeping, being Brits and not used to tipping, but we left some money and beer for our cleaners because we were so impressed at the standards.
Breakfast always had plenty on offer, agree with others it is pretty sameish but there is enough on offer to have something different every day of our 6 night stay.
Even the little fitness centre has one of every cardio machine you'd want on vacation.
I wouldn't just recommend this to a friend, I'd want to hide in their suitcase and stay here again.Really enjoyed staying here. Two-bedroom suite was spacious and clean and the bed was comfortable. Nice large bathroom. Front desk was helpful, so helpful that they organised a town car out to the airport and organised a tour of the Boeing factory for us. Breakfast was average, but OK and certainly was enough to keep you going until lunch. Just don't expect too much. The hotel is a few blocks from the Space Needle and a 2-minute monorail ride into downtown. I enjoyed my stay here and can highly recommend it. The free internet in the lobby is a bonus.The staff was pleasant and helpful. It was close to a lot of exciting things to see and do.I stayed at this Hampton for one night while attending a business event at nearby Seattle Center. The first thing you will notice is that the property layout takes some getting used to. I had a king room on the suite side - not accessible from the lobby level. I got a very detailed explanation (from the very helpful staff!) of the layout but still got lost on my first attempt. Once you get used to it though, it does makes sense. Seems like an unfortunate side effect of fitting the property on that piece of land.
The second thing you will notice (especially if you are a business traveler) is that there are no accessible/practical electrical outlets to plug in a laptop/cell phone/etc. I had to plug in my cell phone and lay it on the floor and literally crawl under the desk and unplug a lamp to plug in my laptop. If there were any better outlets they eluded me during my exhaustive search.
The free internet worked great and the complimentary breakfast was pretty much the same you get from any other Hampton - the coffee was very good. There is also a very nice 24-hour super market one block away that was a nice place to get a late night snack. 
This was not the best Hampton Inn that I have encountered but it was also far from the worst. An okay choice if you need to be close to the Seattle Center and need a reasonably priced option. But charge your cell phone first!Found this Hampton Inn on the GPS. Walked in and inquired if they had a room. Front desk was great. Received great customer service from all hotel employees. Only complaint would be the parking garage - the spaces in the garage were very small and a very tight squeeze. I was very happy to find a space outside of the garage.The hotel itself appeared fairly new. My room was large with a flat screen TV and modern decor. Breakfast consisted of the usual continental items along with french toast, fried eggs and sausage. Free coffee was plentiful 24/7 (It is Seattle, after all). A couple complaints: 1) The internet connection was extremely slow at times. 2) Pillows were too thick and firm...not very comfortable. I also had an issue with a malfunctioning detergent dispenser in the on-site laundry room, but the desk staff quickly took care of it. 
The immediate neighborhood is residential with about 25 restaurants in walking distance, especially west on both Mercer and Roy Sts. A QFC urban grocery store is one block away. The cultural institutions comprising Seattle Center are about a 5-10 minute walk. I wish it was easier to get downtown without having to take the monorail (1st train doesn't run until 9am). Didn't have a car, so ended up walking most of the time. It takes a minimum of 20 minutes one way. Cab fare cost $46 from the airport. Decided to walk downtown and catch the new Link light rail for return trip to airport. Train cost is only $2.50.
Seattle is a pretty expensive city, but the Hampton's room rate was a good value overall.We had a suite. Bedroom had air, rest did not. aseattle was having a heat wave!
Had an enormous kitchen but no place to eat.-only one chair. Parking (fee) was for garage, but not enough space for all cars. Staff very nice, but couldn't make up for deficiencies.We stayed here the night before our cruise. We had a family group of 8 people and had 2 rooms. Each room had 2 double beds and was $171,10 each with the Sr discount. The staff is incredible and so helpful. The only thing missing is a swimming pool. The hotel is only a block away from a 24 hour QFC grocery store, where you can also get sandwiches, chicken, salads, soups etc, from their deli area. They even let us use their microwave in the breakfast area to warm up the chicken. (No microwaves or refrigerators in the room) They are only a few blocks from Seattle Center, home to Key Arena, the Space Needle, the Pacific Science Center, an amusement area, and the SciFi and Music Building. We did not particularly like the Sci Fi museum, but the music side had lots of interesting things that kids might like, including recording your own CD. We took a taxi the next morning to the pier and it was about $11, plus tip. The breakfast was a typical continental breakfast. I asked if they would let me leave my luggage there the day we returned, as our flight did not take off until 10:30 that evening and they quickly said yes. So that's what we did. We took a taxi back for $9, plus tip, dropped off our luggaage,. walked a few blocks to the Seattle center and then took the monorail to downtown Seattle, where we explored, then took the monorail back, took the hotel's town car to the airport, a $40 fee. The duck tour is about 4 blocks away, too and we enjoyed that !! I recommend this place!We selected this hotel because we were attending the annual Bumbershoot Arts Festival. It is within a few blocks of the Seattle Centre which was perfect. We had a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen for $200 per night. I thought is was OK value. It includes breakfast every morning. I was dissapointed by the amount of styrofoam used for plates and so on. I would have assumed that hotels were a bit more environmentally consious these days. The breakfast was greasy average. As an alternative there is a QFC grocery store within a block of the hotel. If you were staying longer it would be easy to do all your own meals. The negative about the location is that it is quite a ways away from the rest of downtown seattle. Not the place to be if you are headed to a Mariners or Seahawks game. Rooms were clean and well appointed. The free wired internet was a nice surprise.My husband and I stayed here the first weekend of April. This was my second time to Seattle, WA. Overall, the location was great being close to the Seattle Center. I wish parking wasn't extra. The hotel staff was courteous, helped with directions to University of Washington, and also helped us print out our boarding passes for Southwest Airlines. The room was very clean and quiet. Loved having free internet service. The morning breakfast was sufficient, usual eggs, bisquits and gravy, toast, muffins, yogurt, fruit, juice and coffee. I would stay there again in the future.I was in town for the Microsoft World Business Intelligence Conference. To save a little for our company and to keep with the expected standard, we chose the Hampton Inn Downtown. 
Most everything was right on where I would expect for a Hampton. The bed was great. The room was very clean as was all areas of the hotel. The front desk staff was excellent.
Where this property fell a little was in a couple of areas. First, my high speed internet did not work. I relocated and still, it was down. I travel 2-3 times per month and do not have issues with my laptop. I proved this 2 days later in CT by hooking up at that hotel just fine. Hampton tried to right it but after the first move, I was uninterested in moving again as I have an air-card that I can use to connect. 
Second, the hot breakfast on our three mornings was just OK. They took the cheap route with plain scrambled eggs, etc. Other Hamptons (See Carmel, IN review) have omelets and other foods with a little extra pizazz. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the free breakfast. It was good - just not in the uppr tier for Hamptons.
Last, I think parking there is a pain. They have a garage with a low ceiling and Thrifty gave us a small SUV. Too many cars park in the ouside SUV spots instead of in the garage where they can actually go. They should take more care in regulating this. This is especially true since they charge $12 per night to park. Being just outside of the core downtown area, I think that is pretty steep.
Overall, I would stay here again and am a loyal Hilton/Hampton traveler. I think this property needs to find the extra 1% that will set this property out above the rest.We stayed at the Hampton Inn and Suites in Downtown Seattle for two nights prior to a cruise to Alaska.
Our taxi from the airport cost us $40
The hotel was well situated close the the Space Needle and within easy walking distance of Pike Street Market and the main shopping area. (warning - it is quite hilly) A monorail runs from the Needle to the edge of the retail district and you can hop on and off metro buses within a free zone in the centre if you feel you cannot walk.
 There was a large 24hr supermarket I block away which was very well stocked. And across the road up the hill was a nice little bar that was buzzing.
The beds were large and very comfortable and the rooms were at a nice temperature. The bathrooms were clean and the shower was good with the usual complimentary toiletries.
The breakfast buffet was good with fruit, cereals, a small selection of hot items and toast with jams, marmalade etc.
Coffee was always available in reception and there was free internet access. The folks on reception were very friendly.
All in all a place I could recommend.We just returned from 2 nights at the Hampton Inn in Seattle. The hotel is average and our room was clean. The breakfast does get crowded the later you go down, but you can ask for a cardboard tray and take your goodies back up to your room. Two things made our stay less than exciting: 1) the street noise, and 2) the ""neighborhood"". The street noise - our 1 bedroom suite faced 5th Avenue on the 5th floor. There was constant street noise from 7 am to 11 pm. There are some bus stops right across the street and the buses are coming and going all day. In addition the street is well traveled by what sound like party going pedestrians. It was impossible to leave the windows open at night with all the noise. Did I mention the loud belch that we heard at 11 in the morning?
The neigborhood, or lack thereof - we were travelling with our six year old son and did not find any of the good restaurants within walking distance. There were homeless people to walk by on the way to downtown/Space Needle and we walked by 2 men and their cloud of pot smoke just a block from the hotel in the middle of the afternoon. 
I guess this would seem like a better hotel if we wanted to drive everywhere and were heavy sleepers (or a bit hard of hearing).This was our first stay at a Hampton Inn - and we enjoyed it very much.. Its nice to have the staff look at you and smile when you meet them in the hallway. The breakfast was pretty good - and the room was clean and comfortable. 
I'm not sold on the location - its fairly close the Space Needle - but not ""downtown"" as the description says - its also tricky to find and get into because of the one way streets and Seattle's general lack of signage. 
There are many Thai restaurants around there and we really enjoyed a meal at Tup Tim Thai - which is a short drive away - excellent food.A friend booked us into the Hampton Inn for a weekend trip to Seattle. She didn't realize that the hotel was in the Seattle Center area. The Seattle Center area is cheesy and not really clean. There aren't a whole lot of quality restaurants within the area either. However, there is an awesome supermarket about 4 blocks from the hotel called Metropoliatan Market. It has a a fantastic selection of prepared foods, wine, beer and chocolate.
The Hampton Inn looked like it had been beat up by years of catering to the party crowd. Our two bedroom suite was large, but walls, carpet and furniture were marked up like someone had hosted several keg parties. The air conditioning wasn't working properly and it happend to be the hotest weekend Seattle has had all summer. Our carpet was wet in several spots - perhaps they had just cleaned the carpet after a party???
Although the room was a two bedroom, two bedroom suite. There wasn't enough seating in the living room for four people.
The breakfast room was super crowded each morning, but the hotel staff did a good job replenishing the food and keeping the tables clean.
All in all it wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't want to stay in that area again. There are tons of better hotels in the downtown area that you can usually get for a good price on priceline.We just had another great stay at the Hampton Inn Seattle. We arrived at the hotel at 1100am thinking we would store are bags and check in later that afternoon. The desk clerk, who couldn't have been nicer, found us a room right then and there. He was even able to put us in a room off the street, and thus we enjoyed very quiet nights.
The room itself was very nice. As usual with Hampton Inns, the room was very clean and nicely decorated.
The hotel is in a great location. It's about a 5-7 minute walk to the Space Needle, and also to the Monorail to take you right downtown. 
There is also a Supermarket (open 24 hours) a block away from the hotel. This was very convenient for us as we needed to pick up a few things since we were leaving on a cruise at the end of our stay.
Another nice feature of the hotel is that it has two computers in the lobby and two more in their business center guests to use. It was nice to be able to use the internet without a charge.
In conclusion, I would definitely recommend the Hampton Inn Downtown Seattle. Great staff. Nice rooms Great location.Stayed at the Downtown Hampton for 5 nights. It was perfectly adequate as most Hampton Inn's are. Rooms predictable as was the breakfast. No pool - but we expected that. Within a short walk to Space Needle and surrounding activities. 30 minute walk to the piers and good pier restaurant. 45 minute walk to Pike's market. Can take the bus - so no big deal. The hotel's layout is odd and confusing. Because it is on a hill, the 3rd floor is the lobby. It's elevators lead to different sections of the hotel - and navigating the hallways and finding the fitness room, etc was more challenging than it should have been.Nice location. Great people. They care about your needs and concerns.This is the 2nd time I have stayed here (within a year) and both times, the staff has been extremely helpful and patient. I came in late and they had my reservation correct ( I had 2 separate reservations) and provided me with helpful information about local restaurants. Several times over the weekend I observed the staff offering information about local sights, tours and cruise information. Staff was very patient with the many questions from guests. In addition, construction is going on in the lobby which makes the area pretty tight. Front desk staff handled all inquiries professionally. I recommend this hotel.
Hotel location is near the space needle, safe walking distance; also near grocery store to buy water and other snacks.We stayed at this Hampton Inn while on a trip to Seattle. The room was nice and spacious with a recently updated bathroom. The bathroom had a large vanity with a granite top and instead of a tub there was a large shower stall. 
The hotel itself was nice but under construction when we were there. The 4th floor was being renovated so during the day it was hard to get an elevator because they were being used by the workers. The lobby is incredibly small and the breakfast is in one of the conference rooms and is modified from the normal Hampton Inn breakfast. The downfall of the hotel other than the construction (which I assume will soon be gone) is that it is a bit confusing. If you are the 6th floor you can't ride the elevator from the parking garage to your room, you have to walk halfway across the hotel to the other elevator. Also, the business center and workout room are on the other side of the hotel from where the lobby is located, so in other words not the normal Hampton Inn layout that you may be familiar with. 
The location is very convenient to the Space Needle, not too far of a walk to the Public Market (15 mins), and there is a QFC (grocery store) close by if you need anything.We stayed at the Hampton Suites and Inn 7/15, 16, 2011. Hotel is getting old however they are renovating. No problems with our stay. Staff very nice, our room wasn't ready when we arrived they made a special effort to get two rooms ready as we were traveling with family.. Room clean, bed wonderful. Food for breakfast typical, not great, worked for us. The location is great. within walking distance to the space needle and also the market. Weather was not great on Saturday so we did the hop-on-hop off bus tour saw the city a couple of times. 
Had dinner on Saturday nigh at the Flying Fish great food.
Over all I would stay there again is it a bargain for Seattle.My wife and I stayed with our 15 year old son in a suite for 6 nights. We only intended to stay for two nights. But when the Sea to Sky Highway was closed by an rock avalanche, our trip to Whistler was cancelled and the Hampton was a comfortable experience the first two nights so we stayed another four. The rooms are not ultra fancy, but have all the amenities needed for a convenient and comfortable stay. The king size bed was incredibly comfortable and was very quiet at night despite most of the rooms being filled. Our son slept on the hide-a-bed without complaint. Room service was very good. Everything was as clean as could be. Free breakfast and coffee was good. We walked to all the tourists spots downtown even though we had a car parked in the hotel garage. Overall a great experience.Given it's proximity to downtown and the Seattle Center, I expected to pay much more. My room was clean and well kept, as you would expect at any Hampton Inn. The front desk staff (when they weren't swamped - see below) was helpful in directing us to various restaurants in the area. They have a free hot breakfast and free cookies at night. The location is nearly ideal since 5th Ave. also has a major bus route that goes right downtown in just a few minutes. Also, if this is your thing, there is an excellent CD/record store right across the street. 
The major complaint about this hotel I have is that the hotel doesn't appear able to handle the large crowds that sometimes stay there. The day we checked in we waited in the packed lobby for about 20 minutes before anyone helped us. Also, if you don't get to the breakfast area early enough, you'll be hard pressed to find a spot to sit.
One day when we were there we tried to use the washing machine and it was broken. We didn't find that out until after our clothes were in there, though. We made several calls to the front desk asking for someone to come look at it (there was no ""out of order"" sign or anything) and they kept promising to send someone up but no one ever came. We chalk that up to the fact that people were swarming the front desk staff with check-ins and they just forgot about it. Again, the volume of people staying at this hotel exceeds its capacity to service them well.
But, for the price in that location, it's a good deal and someplace I will probably stay at next time I'm in Seattle.We stayed for a few days before our cruise. The hotel was close to some average restaurants, but mostly it was close to the monorail and the needle--just a couple of blocks. Plus, cab fare was @ $7 to Pike's Market or any restaurants near the piers, same amt to the cruise dock.We stayed here the night before and the night after our cruise. I give it an excellent rating because it is a very good value, the location is great, and the staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. It is not a fancy hotel by any means, but our rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable, and the coffee, tea, hot chocolate and ice water in the lobby were a very nice touch. You can easily walk to the space needle and there is a bus stop right across the street which will get you wherever you want to go. If you prefer, the hotel will call a cab for you. Unless you are looking for luxury (and willing to pay for it!) you simply cannot go wrong with this hotel.We were placed here by a hotel that lost our reservation. Because we came over from a ""boutique hotel"" we thought we'd be disappointed, but they were so friendly and the rooms perfectly clean - all was great. Nothing amazing, but wonderful location within walking distance of attractions and wharf. Also, the front desk always had water bottles, coffee, etc. out for their guests. Again, very simple, but good location and five minutes from cruise pier.The hotel was a short walking distance to the Seattle tower and monorail. The room we had was a typical hotel room but there were larger rooms and suites. The staff was very accommodating and there was always water, coffee and tea available near the front desk. The breakfast area was being remodeled so the choices were limited but sufficient. There was a grocery store a block away and restaurants within a short walk. It is possible to walk to the wharf area but it was a ways but very doable.Hampton Inns are usually very nice, and although this one is being rehabbed, the rooms are very nice. It is in a great location and is close to the Space Needle. The parking for a city hotel is very reasonable. Parking is $15 each day, and the room rates are reasonable for a city hotel. One can also get transportation to the pier for a reasonable price which makes it a great place to stay before or after a cruise.Overall, a nice Hampton Inn. Very friendly staff at the front desk. Provided you with bottled water, cookies (in the evening), and an endless supplier of coffee. The room was nicely furnished. No wear or maintenance concerns were noted. Received a USA Today daily. Breakfast is continental style with microwave english muffins (egg, ham, cheese), fruit, yogurt, pastries, cereal, oatmeal. Some mornings the small breakfast room was very crowded for this large hotel. The front lobby has bathrooms available with use of room key. Also, the lobby has a PC with internet access and a printer.
During my visit, the hotel was expanding with construction in progress. While construction noise was not an issue for us as we where out an about during the day, it did cause one major problem....Parking. The construction has reduced the available parking at the hotel by about a third. 
One other issue on parking, the parking spaces are very tight/small. I found it difficult to park without assistance to get the car into the parking space (and then hard to get out of the car due to room between cars. Parking was $15 per day.
To sum it up.... excellent Hampton Inn (unless you have a car).This hotel is strategically located in downtown - close to the Space Needle, a monorail away from the shopping centres, very close to many restaurants etc. The exterior has good looks, interior was undergoing repair, has spacious rooms, is well lit and courteous staff especially at the reception etc etc. The food outlets in the hotel are good and the breakfast pretty decent. We would love to go back to the hotel and stay with them once again.I found this Hampton Inn while traveling for business and liked it so much I made it our family hotel when we travel to Seattle. The location is fabulous. You are right across the street from Seattle Center (more or less) and can walk to great grocery stores and restaurants within a few minutes. I have stayed here with and without a car and rarely needed a car. 
The property is nice, not fancy, but it is well-kept and safe. The suites are fabulous if you have kids. We got one with 2 bedrooms and a fold out in the ""living area"". It had a great view of the Space Needle and came with a fireplace. Wow! What a great stay. There are Televisions in each room to keep most everyone entertained. 
The breakfast is free and is the standard Hampton Inn breakfast. Tea and Coffee and cookies are available all day. 
If you'd like to cook your own meals, the suites come with full kitchens and are stocked with wine glasses and cookware. It's fantastic. But you may not need the kitchen because the restaurants are so great...and just down the street.
Our favorite thing was the Metropolitan Market a few blocks up the road. Check out the deserts, wine and beer selections. You will be in heaven. 
The kids love all the activities in the Seattle Center...you can take the monorail to the mall downtown and walk around. You will not be bored!!!
Great value for Seattle.During our Pac NW road trip, we were only able stay 1 night at this property but will be sure to return on another occasion. At the end of our vacation, our stay in Seattle was to include a visit to the Space Needle, 4th of July Fireworks, the Ballard Locks and possibly Pike Place. Since we are Hilton Honors members and always enjoy our Hampton stays for the comfort and hot breakfasts, it was our first choice. We could have stayed DT but the Seattle Center was only a short walk from the hotel and given our short time here it was the best option.
The front desk was helpful in providing directions to the fireworks display at Lake Union (within walking distance) and recommending a nearby restaurant (McMinneman's) where we had a nice meal beforehand. 
Our room had the most comfortable beds that are the hotels signature selling point. Our daughter wanted to stay another night just to be able to sleep in the bed again! 
Our only disappointment was not with the hotel, but with the Space Needle b/c they stopped selling tickets at 8 pm the evening of the 4th for a private event. This was pretty much our only opportunity to see the view with clear skies as we were leaving early the next day. We eventually went up in the am only to see a cloudy view. This inconvenience also cut into our morning plans to visit Pike Place so had to skip that and hit the road to go home. 
We will definitely return to the Hampton Inn for the convenience of the location; hospitality of staff and most importantly a great night's rest.The hotel is your typical Hampton Inn. The rooms are pretty standard and what is expected from a Hampton Inn. The location is very good as it is very close to the Space Needle and EMP. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast area gets very crowded in the mornings. There are not enough tables for the number of guests that stays here.This hotel is a standard Hampton Inn - nothing fancy, but reliable and clean. The rooms are pretty much standard for a Hampton so you'll know what to expect. 
The hotel's common space was woefully inadequate for the huge amount of guests. The free breakfast buffet was so cramped and crowded that most people were eating standing up in the hallways, at the front desk or even outside the front entrance of the hotel! Waits for the two elevators took forever. This hotel is just too big for the capacity of guests it can hold. It was an absolute crowded nightmare at every turn!
The location is good and is within walking distance of a large 24 hours grocery store and a McDonald's. The Space Needle and EMP museum are also a few blocks away. The neighborhood isn't the best, so if you are from the country of suburbs or aren't used to urban city life, the area may intimidate you. This is a very urban hotel.We stayed at this hotel the night before leaving on a cruise. The location was great - a short walk from the Space Needle where you can catch the monorail to get downtown quickly. The staff was friendly, the breakfast was great and the bed was amazing. The next morning the staff was very helpful to all the folks in the lobby arranging transportation to the cruise terminal. We took the Downtown Airporter/connector to get to the hotel from SeaTac airport and the cruise terminal was a $10 cab ride. I would highly recommend this hotel.I love business hotels. They're more affordable than the big names (i.e. the nearby Hilton) and they come with great perks. Breakfast was delicious every morning. They even had bagged breakfast to go if you were in a hurry. There were warm cookies in the afternoon and there was always a selection of coffee. The lobby had 2 computers and a printer (for free!) to check email and print our boarding passes. There were snacks in our room when we arrived. To me, all that equals up to resort living downtown! The location is great, right down the street from the space needle, EMP, and monorail stop. There's a 7-11 right next door as well as a grocery store in case you'd rather do that then eat out. The front desk help was great and knowledgeable.Absolutely loved my stay here. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly, location is great (just a short walk to the space needle) and the included breakfast was good. The rooms were clean and well kept. Really impressed, if I ever get back to Seattle there is no need to find anywhere else!Hotel very nice. Breakfast is the usually Hampton good fare. Free parking. Location is a bit off the beaten track the a short drive to the Space Needle and the surronding area. Quiet.This hotel is right in the center of everything - it's only a 2-block walk to Seattle Center which includes the Space Needle, the Children's Museum, an amusement park, the SciFi Museum, etc. 
It's clean and neat and the employees are what you'd expect from a Hampton Inn: polite, friendly and thorough. Nothing too fancy here, but we weren't looking for that.
One downside: we experienced lots of traffic noise. Cars zooming back and forth, horns honking, brakes squealing, etc. 
We enjoyed the free breakfast in the morning, and the 24-hour market on the next block was a wonderful plus! (Although the management in the QFC Market was really rude to us, but that's another story.) 
Our son came down with a fever while we were at the Hampton Inn and we needed to stay an extra night. The staff at the front desk couldn't have been nicer and made the change in a matter of seconds. Perhaps they saw I was a Mama on the Edge after a long, sleepless night with a burning-up child!Good wallet-friendly hotel. Great location near the Seattle Center. A quick walk to the monorail which will take you downtown. Grocery store is a block away, so very convenient. My only complaint is the internet access in the room. I switched rooms twice and the net still wasn't working properly. Other than that, no complaints. The front desk staff was pleasant and helpful. Don't expect the Hilton, but for the money and location, it is a good value.The free breakfast is great. Your choice of eggs, meats, bagels, breads, fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt and drinks. The staff is so friendly too! They helped us get around the area as it was our first time in Seattle. Stayed 5 nights and room was always nice and tidy when we came back at night. We stayed in a 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite that was literally the size of a nice apartment. Had a full kitchen and balcony too. I love this hotel and will go back for sure!We have just spent 4 nights at this hotel and enjoyed every moment of our stay. The hotel is a short walk from the Space Needle and from there the Monorail takes you straight into Downtown.
The staff were very helpful, especially when I lost an article of clothing. They were friendly and pleasant and always took time to speak to you. Our room was large and spacious with a comfortable bed and pillows - very important to us!
There was a good selection of food for breakfast (this was included in the room rate). Coffee was available all the time. 
We would recommend this hotel as a good choice for travellers to Seattle.My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights during sightseeing vacation in Seattle. It was a great pick. Not only is the hotel about a 5 minute walk from the EMP/Space Needle, its easy to catch the monorail and ride into down town. Several times we picked a street 4th, 2nd, or 1st streets and walked to and from downtown, which took about 20 minutes. Its a great way to learn the city. Also one jewel we found was a QFC market one block away in the bottom floor of new loft apartments. We would stop here each night on our walk home and stop in just to explore the gourmet fare. There is also a bus stop across the street that makes stops all along downtown and at the WA state ferries (this however is not in the ""free zone""-but only cost $1.50-$1.75). Very convenient. 
The room was wonderful, clean and comfortable. The breakfast was superb as well as the constant supply of coffee and hot water in the lobby. Staff were very helpful, professional, and polite. 
This was an excellent place to stay, would certainly stay here again!The location of the hotel is very close to Seattle Centre, and about a 20 minute walk from downtown. The 24hour QFC next to the hotel was very convenient to stock up on food. The hotel breakfast was worth getting up for. The parking spaces are a little tight but we managed fine in our mazda hatchback. Staff was great, check in and out were flawless and the cookies at the desk are REALLY good! Didn't hear anything from any other rooms or traffic during our stay. Big rooms with lots of space. It would be nice to have a mini-fridge in the rooms that are not suites.This is a great little Hampton Inn! The front desk staff are superb! They greeted us, recognized the Hilton Diamond status...upgraded the room without being asked...gave us a cookie and pointed out the Thai place around the corner as a good restaurant. What more can you ask???
The suite was nice enough...a little dated, but otherwise very comfortable. The only problem with the place is the layout of the property...you have to walk a mile to your room! 
This is an excellent place to stay prior to taking the Victoria Clipper to Victoria...only about a 10 minute cab ride...
We stayed here on the way on three separate occasions over the course of 5 weeks and each time was exactly what I expect from a Hampton Inn....Good Value...clean room and courteous staff.We stayed in regular room with king bed for one week. Overlooked inner courtyard. Room was fairly quiet except for neighbors playing TV too loudly one night. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Free breakfast is a super time and money saver--a pretty decent range of hot and cold foods. Coffee is always available in lobby. Hampton Inn beds are always wonderful and this was no exception--felt great after walking for miles each day. You can get the monorail to downtown nearby (about 5-minute walk to monorail). You can also walk downtown if you like a longer walk. The bus stops we needed weren't very convenient (had to walk under an overpass) but doable. The monorail is easiest way to Nordstrom/Macy's and downtown shopping--it's just $2 and 2-minute ride. Easy walk to Pike Market from monorail station. Queen Anne neighborhood felt fairly safe. The only minor snafu: upon checkout we received two bills--one of which was right and another that billed us a higher rate for a few days. The front desk took care of it with no trouble. There's a 24-hr grocery store across the street which was awesome--it also houses a Starbucks in case the lobby coffee aint cutting it. All in all a very nice experience especially considering the price ($98 and $125 with AAA).Our ultimate accolade? Had our flight been canceled we would have LOVED staying another night. Or two. Or three. As it was, we stayed 5 nights and felt right at home. It was a crowded week in Seattle so we couldn't get a suite, but the King room was ample, with desk, easy chair & ottoman, and the most comfortable bed in the world. This is not an exaggeration. It is the most comfortable bed in the world. Bar none, even ours at home. The bathroom has double sinks, fast flushing toilet, and good shower. With the incredible QFC market across the street, and a good breakfast free every morning, our lives were made easier.
Also, cable internet in the room so the wifi difficulties we encounter everywhere did not exist. Downstairs are 2 computers with CD readers and printers - free and usually available. LOCATION: Two blocks from the Space Needle and Monorail. Going into town? Take the monorail: $4 R/T for adults, $2 R/t seniors and you're on Pine Street in 5 minutes. Within a few feet of Macys - a block from Nordstroms - 3 or so blocks from Pike Market. Flying in? Save yourself wear and tear. Don't rent a car at the airport - it takes forever and costs a bundle. Take the shuttle or, best, a towncar* $35 each way total - and worth every cent - to the Inn, rent a car from Budget on 7th Ave - they'll pick you up at the Inn. Cheap. Easy.
Inn Parking is $10+/- a night and the stalls are very small. Our Impala was a very tight fit - and some crazies park pick-ups and SUVs in the underground. Think small car. *We were recommended to use 'Dale' [--]. He was great and I'm saving his card for our February trip.I liked this hotel and recommend it, but there are a few things to be aware of.
First the positives: it is in a great location downtown with easy access to the Space Needle and Seattle Center. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast was better than the typical muffin and fruit spread. The room was large and comfortable and relatively quiet.
Now, the things keeping it from a 4 star in my book: while it has a good location, it is difficult to get to. Once you're there, parking is a nightmare, and they charge $12/night for parking (not a big deal, except that you then have to navigate the maze of garages to find a spot.) Once you are parked, the you must get from your car to your room, which is not as easy as it sounds. The hotel is many buildings connected together and only linked on one floor, so you will likely have to take an elevator to one floor, walk to the proper building, then take another elevator to your floor. It's very strange.
All in all, however, I will likely stay here when I return to Seattle.Very Clean and Modern room. Located very close to the space needle. Great room with fireplace and kitchen. Excellent value. We walked to downtown which may be too much for some but we found it to be a nice and peaceful hotel.Stayed here late September for 3 nights.
The best part of the hotel is the location and its complementary breakfast.
The hotel is just about an 8 minute walk to the Seattle Center, home to the Space Needle, Sci Fi Museum, and Experience Music Project, among other things. 
There are a few restaurants near by but they generally didn't open until 5 pm or were coffee shops or were more of a walk than you'd first think. Front desk didn't have a map to consult nor was there a shuttle service as I've had at other Hampton Inns and Suites.
Being near the Seattle Center, though, lowers your hotel rate yet you are still very near the Downtown area if you just take advantage of the Monorail, which is just $4 for a round trip. It drops you off at Westlake Center and from there you can easily access the Public Market and Waterfront.
The hotel itself was clean. The layout is odd; lobby on the third floor; business center on the first. The entrance on 5th takes you to the lobby no problem, so just go in through that one.
The room was clean and had standard Hampton amenities. The room was quite large and had a large safe, which was a nice plus.
Service was ok. Once something needed fixing but I had to call out twice to get service. 
The breakfast was good. The Hampton Inns and Suites tend to have larger offerings than do the regular Hampton Inns and this one was no exception. They offered waffle sticks, eggs and sausage, many muffins and breads, fruits, yogurts, cereals, and oatmeal.
Overall, I'd recommend this hotel as a great way to save money on your hotel and use it elsewhere while still being able to reach most Seattle attractions easily.My daughter, 3 year old granddaughter and I stayed at the Hampton Inn & Suites in Seattle near Seattle Center for a week in August. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and our suite was nicely furnished with a dishwasher in the kitchen and extras such as paper towels, etc. We thought the complimentary breakfasts were very good. The location was nice for walking to Seattle Center and for walking to some good restaurants close by. Our only complaints were the street noise when we opened the balcony door at night for fresh air and the tight parking places in the garage. Many big SUV's took up more than one space and it made parking difficult at times.We just returned from our first visit to Seattle. Originally when I was planning this trip I wanted to stay more downtown. But after the trip, I am glad we stayed at this hotel. It is right down the street from the Space Needle very convenient location. I agree with other reviews that this hotels parking garage is much to be desired. The parking sports are extremely small and take some manuvering but not impossible. To make it easy on yourself, park outside if you can find a spot. The breakfast was what I would expect but changed everyday. The staff kept a constant supply coming and the hours were from 6 to 10 each morning. The food ranged from fresh fruit mix, hot and cold cereal, juices, toast, buttermilk biscuits, muffins and bagels. Each day there was a hot dish which was either scrambled eggs, waffles, sausauge patties, and sunny side up eggs. Of course there was coffee and my teens liked the hot chocolate. They also have breakfast bags to go for those in a hurry. At 3PM, there are fresh baked cookies at the front desk. They were yummy. We were on the 6th floor, the top floor. There are skylights in the hallways and in the afternoon the floor was always warm. Our room was on the street side, but there was hardly any noise. My family didn't like the beds much. They were just OK. The room was clean and they always cleaned the room very quickly. The staff was pleasant. At times, you had to wait at the front desk. They should have another person working. There are 2 computers in the lobby area. Only one that you could print from, but this was very nice. We had our laptop, but when I wanted driving directions or to print out information, it was handy that it was right near the breakfast area. The ice machine didn't work or was under construction on our floor, so I went down a floor same situation. Just had to go down to the main floor to get ice. No big deal. All in all I would definitely stay here again.we stayed at the Hampton Inn for 3 nights with another couple in a 2 bedroom apartment, apartment was bright, light and airy and well appointed with a full sized kitchen, good sized lounge area, and each of the bedrooms also had a TV. Bathroom was a decent size also.
At the time we stayed there had been a recent flooding due to an ice machine and there were large drying machines in the corridor and carpets had been pulled up in some rooms, luckily we were at the end of a corridor and could not hear the noise from the drying machines but did have to walk past numerous machines and around electrical cords to reach our room.
Breakfast is included and there was a good selection of cereals, toast, bagels, pastries etc plus a couple of hot dishes, food was nice and you could grab a 'breakfast on the run' from the front desk if you did not have time for a sit down breakfast.
location was good, couple of blocks from space needle and monorail, we walked most places however without issue, there are homeless people in most areas but not a major nuisance.
our only gripe is that when we were checking out we asked the staff for the best way to get 4 of us with large bags to the airport, we spoke to several different members of staff and they all recommended the town car service at a flat rate of $35, we queried several times if car would be big enough for our luggage and were advised no problem.
when the car came to pick us up he said that we wouldnt be able to fit the luggage and would get a bigger car, they appear to be based at the hotel so this only took a couple of minutes, imagine our surprise when we got to the airport and he demanded payment for $65 due to having to use a larger vehicle (a suburban), we had no choice but to pay, at no time when he swapped vehicles did he mention a difference in fee, had we known we would have looked at other options. 
This incident ruined an otherwise great stay, I emailed the hotel about this a couple of days later to make them aware but there was no offer to refund us the additional cost.The Hampton Inn & Suites Seattle DT is located 1 block away from Seattle Center and with easy access to 99 and the I-5. This was a great location because it was within walking distance to the Seattle Center Attractions (Space Needle, Monorail, Experience Music Project, Pacific Science Center and Children’s museum) . The monorail takes you right into the heart of the Shopping district and within walking distance of Pike Place Market – makes a good alternative to driving a car. And for only $2 one-way very affordable – but back to the hotel.
The Hampton Inn staff were very kind to me – since I was staying for a week, they did put me on the 6th (top) floor facing the courtyard – so the room was quiet. Actually the rooms are very well insulated because I did not hear one shower/bath or toilet flush the entire stay. The only noise that penetrated the room was the doors shutting in the hall way – and this was only a problem in the morning
The beds are very comfortable and have nice white duvets and feather pillows. I stayed in a king room and got a good night sleep each night I was there. The bathrooms are large and have showers with good water pressure – although being on the 6th floor I did have to wait a bit for the hot water. I stayed in a regular room #617, so I cannot comment on the suites. 
Hampton offers free wireless high-speed internet access. I did have a little trouble accessing the internet wirelessly – but an Ethernet cord was provided in the room so once hooked up had no problems accessing the internet. For those that do not bring a computer with – the hotel offers two computers in the lobby for guest use. The hotel computers are hooked up to a printer so it makes it easy to print maps, walking tours, tickets or boarding passes.
Of course being a Hampton, they provide complimentary breakfasts. They always had a fruit, cereals, baked goods (muffins, bagels, toast) and hot breakfast option (my favorite being the French Toast Sticks – but the waffles and scrambled eggs were also good). And in the afternoon they provided cookies – I was only back at the hotel early enough for these one day – but the cookies were good!
The staff of the hotel were very pleasant, for my first night they did provide information on local restaurants and an map of the local vicinity. In addition they provide me with information on the Northwest Folk Life festival that was taking place the first weekend I was there.
The hotel offers parking under the hotel in three different parking areas. If you have a car they will assign a parking area to you. I heard that the cost for parking was $9.00 per night but I was not charges – I am not sure if that was an oversight or if it truly is free. I recommend checking with the hotel before your stay.
For those with a car, the hotel is conveniently located to several major highways which make getting in, out and around the city convenient. If you are staying in the city longer than a few days, I would recommend renting a car. 
Would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to others. I have attached photos for your review.The Good: 
Great location: 2 blocks from the space needle-a handy landmark if you're driving/walking the city aimlessly.
The Breakfast: sausage; eggs; french toast sticks. Much better than the standard stale donuts most motels pass off as breakfast.
Access: Interstate 5 is just around the corner.
The Bad:
Parking hell: $9 per day for their underground garage with spaces more suited for golf carts. With the cement beams every few feet, trying to park when the garage is partially full is almost impossible.
Noise: Our room was on the 5th floor facing 5th Ave. Even with my trusty fan pumping out white noise, I could still hear the morning traffic. But this had to be better than camping out on the 1st floor. The tiny hallway located there is the main drag for all foot traffic heading to the elevators at the back of the motel.
The Average: 
The rooms were nothing special- your basic plastic shower/tub and theft-proof hangers. I did appreciate the in-room safe located in the closet though.Good value for the money. Parking was about $9 per day and the spaces are tight - I squeezed a full-size car, though. The complimentary breakfast included bread, cereal, a couple hot items (sausage, french toast, ham, etc.) and pastries & fruit. Nothing special, but certainly good enough for a morning bite. The room I had was clean. The desk - I utilize it alot - was accompanied by a modern, but kind of uncomfortable chair...minor complaint. Also, the internet is free, but it was slow for high-speed access. Not really a ""downtown"" hotel.I travel a lot for my job, and it is nice to have a day off here and there in the cities that I work in. I was here for 2 nights, and found the hotel to be clean and very convenient. The Front Desk staff were always helpful, friendly and very efficient. My room was clean & quiet. The breakfast has a lot of choices, and there is always free coffee. The Space Needle is only a 5 minute walk, and you can either taxi it or take a city bus to downtown, merely 10 minutes away. I highly recommend this hotel!We have just returned from a 4-day stay at the Hampton Inn & Suites. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the staff friendly and helpful and the complimentary hot breakfast made the day. There is also free internet service in the lobby.
The hotel's location within walking distance of the Seattle Center and Space Needle was ideal. Also, a bus stop opposite to the hotel , facilitated trips to the shopping area downtown. There are various ethnic restaurants in close proximity to the hotel which made for adventurous eating. 
 I would certainly recommend this hotel to any visitor to Seattle.The hotel is in a good location at the edge of downtown just a few blocks from the Space Needle and is near many good restaurants. There was not a problem with the construction near the hotel, but some band nerds staying in the hotel for a band competition kept us up one night. Hotel security snuffed them out pretty quickly. We enjoyed hot breakfast and the firplace in our room we.We had a one bedroom suite + a very uncomfortable rollaway to accommodate our party of five (two BR not available that night) for a night before a cruise. A typical Hampton - nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable for a night. Easy walk to Space Needle and Duck Tours (we did and enjoyed both), about an $8 cab to Pike Place Market. Note most cabs here only hold 4 passengers, so larger parties need two. At $209/night, the price didn't feel like a bargain, but many hotels were sold out this date and substantially more expensive if available. The free breakfast makes it a better value, but with young kids the convenience is priceless. Front desk help was always pleasant and courteous, and despite a 24-hour advance notice policy for cancellations, they did not force us to pay for our room when we missed the first night due to a last minute problem with our flight. Only negative: halls smelled like smoke (but our room didn't). Also, be aware that suites are all located at far end of horseshoe shaped hotel...a very long walk from lobby if anyone in your party is elderly or handicapped.Booked a 2 bedroom suite with full kitchen. It had 1 double bed in each room with down/feather bedding, 2 full baths, 3 televisions w/ pay per view movies, fireplace, balcony between living room and 1 bedroom, dinette table, & kitchen has bare basics (2 pots, 2 mugs, 2 forks, etc). Layout is very much like an apartment, very comfortable and extremely clean and quiet. Only problem experienced was slight warmth in rooms in late afternoon, couldn't get cooling system functioning easily, opening windows cooled down rooms quickly. Parking is secure and we felt safe anytime of day/night. Use your hotel card key to open the gates and park. Access from garage to rooms is convenient.
Breakfast downstairs is convenient, stocked, organized and fresh. It was never too crowded, could find clean tables, or bring food back to room. Tip: bring serving tray from room to carry plates back to room for dining.
Location is safe and we experienced comfortable walking distance to attractions and amenities with 3 kids and strollers. 2 blocks to 'ride the ducks' amphibian tour (well worth the trip to tour entire city by land and water), 4 blocks to space needle, 1 block to 7-11 (they even have organic milk!) / tower music store. Tip: Dining at space needle for lunch is worth the experience, it includes admission to top. Lunch has $26 minimum, but that is the price of each meal anyway. Taking separate admission cost of $14, you have a 'gourmet' lunch of $12 each with drinks, not bad. We went midweek and had to wait 40 min for seating w/o reservations, so make your reservation in advance!
Wished we hadn't eaten before embarking on Pike's Place - go with an empty tummy! Lots of cafes/shops/eateries/bakeries & wine tasting.
We are 'food junkies' and drove from Bay Area to Seattle. If you do the same or want to make worthwhile stops in between, check out these local treats:
. cupcakeroyale
. snoqicecream
. They served locally produced hazelnut oil at the space needle, delicious dipped with artisan breads: holmquisthazelnuts
In Oregon:

heavenonearthrestaurant - they have cinnamon buns the size of a bowling ball!
Looks like most of the Seattle is under construction, literally. Most of Fisherman's wharf area is under construction or there are new construction projects popping up all over, monorail attraction is out of commission, inner city parks are under beautification projects, museum, etc.. Seattle should emerge in 2007 sparking new.Hotel was clean and beds were REALLY comfy. Breakfast was great...... wonderful fruit salad. The breakie was constantly replenished. Staff was super friendly. It's only a block from the monorail and then an easy walk to Pike Market from the end of the monorail track. Only drawback was that it was noisy at night with street traffic so ask for a room on the inside rather than street side.All the Hampton Inns are very basic hotels. The furniture is more like what you would see in a dorm room than in someone's home. But you should know that going in to any Hampton Inn. 
We spent 3 days at the Seattle location and had a good visit overall. The one hitch was being promised a non-smoking room, but clearly windnig up in a smoking room - with no other rooms available. That is a small thing (overall) but when you're told to your face it is non-smoking and it's not you just question the staff a bit.
This hotel was in good condition. The rooms were clean, the halls well kept, and the dining room area was always in good shape. The breakfast is the somewhat drab Hampton Inn selection which also is dorm quality (but that's what you get at Hampton versus Hilton Garden Inn, for example). It will get you going, but you don't walk away genuinely happy. 
One night we were there they had a bbq for all guests. The staff was there and were very friendly. The front desk people were equally nice and tried hard to satisfy your needs - what to do, where to go, etc.
The location was great for us, though as another reviewer noted, it is not really downtown- it is out by the space needle- walking distance to the Duck Tours, Music Experience, monorail, space needle, basketball stadium. So it is easy to get to downtown. 
If you want luxury, go elsewhere, but for a nice, simple, clean and friendly hotel, it's a great option for your next Seattle escape.This hotel is not in the heart of downtown or the ""cool"" shopping areas, but it's within walking distance of the Experience Music Project, the Family Fun center, and several restaurants. AND the parking is free! Being slightly off the beaten track means it's a little quieter, too.
We drove up from Portland to attend a Mariners game, spending one night here. Our room was spotless and smelled fresh (something we never take for granted when traveling!), the beds were comfortable, the breakfast was bountiful, and the staff were SO polite and helpful! My husband wandered out to the front desk at 9:30 p.m. and requested a down pillow. Bam! There it was, cheerfully procured. 
We walked 7 blocks to a Mexican restaurant called Peso's. YUMMMM! High-end Mexican food, plus a colorful decor, and attractive wait staff. Not especially appropriate for our 7-year-old - no kids' menu - but he was happy with a cheese quesadilla.
We will stay at the Hampton from now on!Comfortable stay, free internet, room clean, quiet, note: not really close to convention center, main downtown area... if you have business or want to check out the bars/restaurants in that area, suggest getting a closer hotel or its taxi time.Our family of four stayed here over New Year's and it was great. We had one of the suites that had a kitchen, fireplace, two bedrooms and a balcony that faced the Space Needle. We had a perfect view for the fireworks on New Year's Eve! Our only problem was that there weren't enough chairs, we had a sofa and two dining chairs, not very good for having a large group. A great place to stay with kids.Great location; great staff! Breakfast was available until 10 each morning, and included a decent assortment of cold cereal, fruit, muffins and one hot dish (eggs, french toast, etc.). Overall, an excellent value.I have stayed at this Hampton inn several times. It is a little farther away from downtown, but it is right across the street from Seattle Center (Music Experience, the Needle, Key Center). The staff is excellent, breakfast is great and the rooms are better than the price, which is very reasonable.This is a great hotel! I stayed there 5 times already, it was always pleasant. The rooms are ""midpriced"", but you get what you pay for. The parking is free (about $10-20 at other hotels), but it can be difficult to find a parking spot during the summer months. Can't beat the location, and the breakfast buffet with hot items is nice.Stayed there for 3 days last month when I visited Seattle. Room was clean, spacious, and comfortable typical of the Hampton Inn franchise. Staff was friendly and helpful with our requests. The hotel is tailored to the business traveler, with business center and meeting rooms, internet access, etc which is a plus for me. The free breakfast buffet was very good, not the usual continental breakfast. If you are going to Seattle for site seeing, this hotel is located within walking distance to the space needle. Highly recommended.This is a good place to stay. Other than the goofy streets of downtown Seattle, you'll be within walking distance of the Space Needle, 1-2 miles from the I-5 freeway, walking distance from several good restaurants. The hotel is clean, fairly modern, good service, and pretty economical. I'll stay here again when in town!Stayed there the night of May 19, 2006, and was really very, very surprised at how great the hotel turned out to be. Never stayed at a Hampton Inn before, but will certainly, highly, recommend this one to anyone staying in Seattle. Only there one night before getting on a cruise ship the following day, but we loved our stay. The staff couldn't have been any nicer to us. I did a lot of research before booking this and had read no negative comments about the place . . . now I see why. I booked this 5 months ago and got a great rate of $145 ($165 with taxes, etc.) for one of the two-bedroom suites. Had a full kitchen with dining area, 2 full bedrooms and 2 baths, a gas fireplace in the living room and a small patio off the living room. Both bathrooms were brand new and spotless, as was the kitchen. We were on the first floor so we had no partiulcar view, but going out onto the patio we could we some of the downtown skyline. Read comments about construction going on, and yes, it look lilke it still is. Must be taking them forever to put up the condo across the street, but we faced a side street (not the construction) and we were there on a Friday night and didn't hear any noise. A couple of pieces of furniture in the living room were a little worn and stained, but not horrendous, and that would be our only complaint. Far from a real complaint in my opinion for the great value and location. Someone posted somewhere that this was an iffy neighborhood. I don't know where that comes from since it's in the Queen Anne neighborhood fringe and only a few blocks from the Space Needle. Neighborhood looked just fine to me. Actually one I'd like to live in if I lived there. Well, I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea that we were very, very pleased by our choice and I think you will be too. Looking forward to going back and staying there again some day. Thanks Hampton Inn for getting our trip off to a great start!We weren't sure what to expect, never having stayed at a Hampton Inn before, but we really liked it. Got the regular room (not a ""suite"" with kitchen etc). Great price- considering the wonderful bed and how convenient the location was to Space Needle and Experience Music Project. Go directly to their website for the best rate. The complimentary breakfast in the lobby had a nice variety. I was able to have whole wheat toast and fresh fruit salad instead of the hash browns, bisquits/gravy and pastries. Am glad that our room was on a higher floor. The ground level seemed very noisy with lots of kids running around.Stayed here for 2 weeks in March. Worse part was all the rain. No need for rental car if working in town. Hotel is next to major metro bus lines (3,4,16) just outside free zone ($1.50 a trip), and return bus drops you off 5 steps from the side entrance. I loved this hotel because I had a big suite with full kitchen - and it was quiet - until contruction out front on the parking garage starts at 7AM. Great restaurants very close by and a few blocks up at Queen Anne. Hotel is very clean and breakfast was actually better than your average Hampton. Hotel right by space needle and key arena. Jabu pub has good happy hour for microbrew - worth a taste!The rain did not dampen my spirits as this was my first trip to Seattle in 9 years. The Hampton Inn & Suites has my highest recommendation. The staff is professional, accommodating, friendly, and, overall, charming. The breakfast was always stocked and the service was efficient. The hot beverages were available ALL day long, and stocked. The room was very comfortable and the noise from the construction project across the street did not disturb me. Business center was fully functioning. The beds are comfortable. The rates are reasonable and the hotel is very close to the Space Needle and the Music Experience Project. Everything worked in the room and I was overall satisfied with the stay. When I return to Seattle, I will definitely return to the Hampton Inn & Suites. Well done!I have never stayed in a Hampton Inn where I was disappointed. YOu know exactly what you will get and there are hardly any surprises. When in doubt, I will always choose a Hampton Inn. We stayed in the Hampton Inn, downtown Seattle recently for three nights. The room was clean, nicely appointed, and quiet. The breakfast was great. (Why is it that the less expensive hotels always have breakfast with the room?) We could walk to the Needle and the Frank Gehry music building. The weather was not great so I am sure that if it had been nicer there were other great places to walk to. Parking was free.
At night, the hot water seemed to run out. I mentioned this to the desk, and they gave us one night free!
Would definitely stay there again.We had a large, comfortable, and roomy suite with a full kitchen. The bedroom did not have an air conditioner, but we found that the fan was sufficient at night even though it was unusually warm (for Seattle) when we were there. The breakfast was excellent. They also had bags of food for those who had to leave early. The business facility had computers and printers. When we arrived they were having a manager's bbq, so we had a full (free) dinner for the whole family. The hotel is large and somewhat confusing in its layout. The location is close to the Seattle Center. From there, the monorail gets you downtown quickly.I only stayed 1 night, but I found the Hampton Inn to be a an excellent value. It is not fancy, but it is clean. If you are in Seattle for a day or two and looking for clean inexpensive place to stay this will do. I paid 99 dollars for the night. If you are looking to stay somewhere a little more central, try the Inn at the Market. About 50 dollars more per night, but also a great valueどこにでもあるハンプトンインの一つで取り立てて他店との違いは無いが、館内は自然光がうまく入って来て大変明るく感じた。ホテルの周りはどことなくのどかな感じで安心して過ごすことが出来た。El hotel esta muy bien ubicado. Muy cerca de un McDonalds y de un mini Market. Las habitaciones son amplias y muy silenciosas. Me toco estar en el 5 nivel. Tiene estacionamiento, algo pequeño, aunque nunca tuve problemas para encontrar lugar para mi coche rentado. Cobran por dia $ 15.00 aprox. por estacionamiento. El desayuno como cualquier Hampton, aunque en el buen sentido. A unos pasos, esta una parada de transporte publico o bien, se puede ir caminando al centro (No esta tan cerca para algunos), aunque mi ultimo recorrido fue ir a la Aguja del Espacio, y de ahi caminar al Pike Place Market. Este hote es bueno, muy comodo y barato. Ampliamente recomendable para conocer todo lo que Seattle tiene! La gente del hotel fue extremadamente amable, incluso a mi llegada al hotel pasadas las 3 de la mañana. Te regalan una botella de agua y deliciosas galletas de chocolate en la tarde! Por supuesto que regresare a Seattle pronto!Positives: schöne, große Zimmer (etwas dunkel wegen kleiner Fenster zur Straße) in gewohnt guter Hampton Inn & Suites (Hilton-Gruppe) Qualität; freundlicher Service an der Rezeption; reichhaltiges Continental Frühstück; nur 5 Gehminuten zur Space Needle
Negatives: Das Hotel liegt an einer viel befahrenen Verkehrsader (5th Avenue), dadurch ist es in den Zimmern zur Straße doch hörbar lauter. Bis Downtown sind es 1,5 Meilen oder ca. 30 Minuten Fußweg. 
Tipps: Ein Zimmer weg von der 5th Avenue geben lassen. Alle O-Busse Richtung Downtown halten direkt vor dem Hotel. Dadurch sind die Geschäfte und Restaurants in Downtown mit Bus in ca. 10 Minuten erreichbar.We stayed at the Hampton Inn Seattle Downtown location for two nights following the Paul McCartney concert. The hotel itself was quiet nice as it is relatively new. The lobbby area is nice offering complementary coffee/ juice and cookies. The staff were exceptionally friendly and very cheerfull. The room was average but very clean with new furniture. A iron and board/ hairdryer and coffee making facilities were included in the room as well. One good thing I noticed was that each floor had its own laundry facilities. The main drawback was its location. It was great for walking to the Key areana and Seattle Centre which is where the Space Needle is but if you wanted to go shopping downtown or find a decent place to eat you had to drive a long ways. The hotel is not really in the downtown area. It is still at least a 15 minute drive to Pioneer Square and to shopping in the downtown retail district. The hotel is almost like its located in a residential type area. The free continental breakfast was excellent and really looked forward to it every morning. I would reccommend this property to anyone who is visiting the city to see a concert at the Key Arena as it is only a 5 minute walk there. For those planning to shop downtown and enjoy the nightlife I would reccommend you stay closer to the downtown city centre.Typical Hampton Inn, which means clean, efficient, and relatively inexpensive. Stayed one night at this hotel and found the staff very friendly. Although I booked a single room I was upgraded to a suite with two bedrooms and a kitchen, and a terrace that overlooked a gas station. The upgrade and interiors were very nice.
The breakfast was good and available early. 
I was disappointed to discover that this is not really a downtown hotel. It's about a mile from downtown, but there are city buses that will take you to downtown. It's not ""in the action"" but it's not isolated, and there are restaurants, convenience stores, and sites to see nearby.I stayed here over a weekend in a 2 bedroom suite. The entire structure is wooden and built in a U shape. Overall, it does look fairly new or at least recently renovated. The beds, though, were not comfortable and the blanket was extremely thin. Yes, I've been spoiled by the Hilton and Starwood beds. Although Hampton Inn is part of the Hilton chain, it certainly doesn't use the same bed. 
The free parking, high speed internet (RJ45 cable included), and breakfast were definitely assets. The downtown hotels generally charge $24-26/night for valet parking. Although I think the Residence Inn (Marriott) has better breakfasts, there were 2 hot entrees at the Hampton. One day I had sausage and waffles, the other day I had eggs and some kind of sausage gravy. In addition, there were bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, cereal, and yogurt.
The weekend I was there was extremely busy. I think that's great for the hotel. However, due to the wooden structure, the noise was ridiculous. I could hear people shuffling around at 1:30 am and the people shouting in the streets certainly didn't help. To top it off, my bedroom was supposedly one of the quieter ones facing the inner courtyard.
Ok, so why did I stay here? After searching through multiple hotels in the city, the Hampton Inn was the only one which advertised 2 queen beds. Since it was offered in their 2 bedroom suite only, I was willing to pay substantially more for it. Problem is, at check-in, I was advised 2 queen beds don't exist and all of the suites had a full and a twin. After I complained about this at check-out, it was resolved to my satisfaction. I have to give them kudos for that.
Although the suites are substantially more money, the normal room rates at the Hampton are quite reasonable and serve its demographic well. However, I will not be returning to this hotel. The monorail is NOT one block away as another poster states and the location is in an undesirable part of Seattle.we came to this hotel as it appeared a good compromise between a not too high price and good quality, while still being close to downtown.
It turned out exactly this, the rooms were quiet and clean, and the staff was very kind and welcoming.
The hotel is very close to the space needle, which means that it's a good base for visiting the city on foot. In the other hand, it took us a while to reach it on foot from the airport, as from the seatec airport railway stop you need to take a bus or the monorail to get close enough to the hotel. With a car on the other hand it's a pain to park in the area, unless you pay the hotel parking.
At the moment they were doing some works to the breakfast room, so for breakfast guests were squeezed in a very small environment with hardly place to sit. I guess they'll have that solved in a few months.Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen, es gab gleich Kekse und auf eine Nachfrage wurde prompt im Internet recherchiert und sogar ausgedruckt.
Im Hotel wird gerade eine Etage renoviert, daher wurde beim Frühstück etwas improvisiert, war jedoch kein Problem. Die Auswahl war für amerikanische Verhältnisse recht gut, jedoch immer noch Plastik-Geschirr.
Die Zimmer waren sehr groß und sauber. Der Zusatz Downtown verwirrt, da mindestens 30 Minuten Fußmarsch entfernt. Das Hotel ist jedoch ganz nah an der Space Needle, EMP etc. und daher sehr zu empfehlen. Ein Supermarkt, der 24h geöffnet hat, ist direkt um die Ecke.
Alles in allem sehr empfehlenswert für einen Aufenthalt in Seattle.Das Hotel befindet sich zentral am Seattle Center. Zum Space Needle sind es 5min zu Fuß. Von dort aus kann man mit der Monorail für 2$ direkt in die City fahren. Parlplätze gibt es leider nicht genügend. Es befindet sich zwar sowas wie eine Tiefgarage im/am Hotel, aber man muss schon ein sehr guter Fahrer sein, um mit einem SUV dort einparken zu können. Wir haben zwar immer ein Parkplatz gefunden, aber es war mehr oder weniger der letzte. Es kostet außerdem 15$ (oder so). 
Die Zimmer sind sehr groß und sauber. Wer Downtown und Space Needle aus dem Fenster sehen will, sollte nach einem Zimmer zur Eingangsseite fragen. Der Ausblick ist wirklich sehr schön. Es gibt neben Wlan auch ein Frühstück, welches eins der Besten auf unserer Reise war. Es gab zum Standard auch Waffeln, Aufwärmsachen für die Mikrowellle und frischen Obstsalat, der eingepackt war. Man konnte sich also auch was mitnehmen.Das Check-In lief super. Wir hatten eine sehr günstige Rate und bekamen das gewünschte ruhige Zimmer. Das Frühstück war sehr vielfältig und lecker, allerdings war alles in Plastik eingepackt. Das Hotel liegt 5 Minuten zu Fuß von der Space Needle entfernt, allerdings ist die Innenstadt etwas weit, deshalb sollte man dahin mit dem Bus oder der Monorail fahren. Seattle ist wunderschön, dennoch war es selbst im Juni ziemlich kühl. Das Hotelzimmer und vor allem das Bad waren ein Traum.Voor wie naar Seattle komt voor de opera is dit een prima hotel. Vijf minuten van de monorail die je in een oogwenk in het hart van Seatlle brengt. Vriendelijke staf, een heus ontbijt (in de prijs inbegrepen), koffie en thee, kranten. Een aanrader.Wer das Hampton Inn Seattle ""Downtown"" bucht, wird überrascht, dass Seattle Downtown in Wirklichkeit nicht fußläufig ist, ca. eine halbe Stunde sollte man einrechnen. Eine Bushaltestelle direkt vor der Tür sorgt jedoch für einen guten Anschluss. Dafür sind die Attraktionen Space Needle, Science Fiction Museum und vor allem das für jeden Musikfreund interessante Experience Music Project nur einen Steinwurf entfernt. Ein bestens sortierter Supermarkt zwischen Hotel und Space Needle ist 24 Stunden geöffnet, ein riesiger Shop mit gebrauchten CDs gegenüber dem Hotel ist ebenfalls einen Besuch wert. Freunde thailändischer Küche ist ""Bahn Thai"", 150 Meter vom Hotel entfernt zu entfernen.
Der Service im Hotel ist freundlich, leider war für unsere Familie (zwei Erwachsene, zwei Jugendliche) nicht wie bei der deutschen Hilton-Zentrale bestellt ein Appartment für vier Personen, sondern nur ein Raum Appartment mit einem Bett und einer Ausziehcouch reserviert worden. Wir übernachteten schließlich mit vier Personen in einem Zimmer mit zwei Queen-Size-Betten unmittelbar auf dem vielbenutzten Weg zwischen Reception und Fahrstuhl. Sollte man das Hampton Inn auswählen, ist die Reservierung eines (ruhigen) Zimmers im ersten oder zweiten Stock unbedingt zu empfehlen. Das Zimmer war sauber und nicht zu beanstanden.Das Hotelfrühstück ist übrigens reichlicher als bei anderen Hotels vergleichbarer Klasse. dafür ist das Preisniveau auch etwas höher.Typical Hampton Inn - clean, comfortable facility and very nice staff. The breakfast buffet was decent, as well. The location is the main selling point for this hotel as it is situated close to the Space Needle with easy access to the highways, downtown, University of Washington, etc. Overall, a good stay.We chose this hotel based on the reviews and its proximity to the Space Needle. On the Hampton (Hilton) web site, I was able to get a special rate of $79/nite, which was phenomenal. The room was very clean, and the king-sized bed was very comfortable. The window actually opened (a big plus), and the climate control worked well. Overall, the room was very attractive and comfortable. We did not try the breakfast or internet connection. For us it was not noisy. 
The walk to the space needle is just a few blocks. There is an additional charge for parking, but it is indoors, and we had a handicap tag, so the location was convenient.Noise was an issue, esp. when the people next door are drunk and noisy at 2am. Maybe the higher-end Hilton brands are better built.
Breakfast was so-so, but the staff people are really nice. One did lead us astray with a recommendation for breakfast - at a bar!! Food at the bar was so-so, and the atmosphere was not appealing.
Secure parking was good. We just weren't familiar with the neighborhood, so it was nice to have gated parking.
There were lots of good restaurants nearby, within walking distance. It was just hard to figure out which ones were the good ones. Great coffee with 1-1/2 blocks.Our family of 17 was booked into the travelodge prior to our cruise, but couldnt bear it. Hampton Inn took our 5 rooms and the guest rooms and public areas were clean and well updated. Family members enjoyed walking to QFC store and some ate at the sushi resturant on the corner. Lobby on the 3rd floor confusing if you come by taxi.We have always had good experiences staying at the Hampton and this was no exception. We booked a 9 night stay for a standard room. Due to unavailability they upgraded us to a suite at no additional charge.
The hotel is located within walking distance of the Space Needle. Buses to downtown can be caught across the street. There is a 24 hour supermarket on the next corner and best of all, a fantastic genuine greek restaurant right up the street.
The room was clean. Internet is included (wired) as is a hot breakfast every morning and fresh baked cookies every afternoon. The staff is overly efficient and quite helpful. We had a problem with our TV one night and maintenance was in to fix it within 3 minutes of our calling the desk.
Seattle is an amazing city with lots to do. In addition to the standard tourist stops (Pike's Market, Space Needle, the Original Starbucks) don't skip the Underground Tour in Pioneer Square and if time allows, a trip up Mt Ranier. We took a tour with Seattle Tours (206-768-1234). Also down the street from the hotel is the Duck Tour (which is ok and fun for kids) and the Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum.
Great food can be found in the International District. We ate at Tai Tung which is a neighborhood institution. The decor has not changed since the 60s and the food was terrific. Ivar's on the pier is a must stop. The best clam chowder ever. For a special treat, check out Wild Ginger on the corner of 3rd and Union. Amazing food, wonderful wines and great atmosphere.
If you visit in the summer, catch a tour (and a game or two) at Safeco Field.
Public transportation is easy to use in Seattle. Since we were staying outside of downtown, the fare was a nominal $1.25 each way ($1.50 during rush hours). Downtown is a fare free zone (which is a good thing since Seattle has very steep hills). A trip on the Monorail is $2.00 each way. It's a great way to see the city.
Go to the Grayline desk for transportation to and from the airport for $10.25 per person, significantly less than a cab ($35 - $40).
We plan on staying at this hotel every time we head to Seattle.We reserved the ""Study with a kitchenette."" It was a deceiving title. It was spacious with two rooms - tv, couch, desk and chair in the extra room, but no kitchen. Basically we had a hotel room fridge and microwave. When we called to the desk they assured us that we could have a kitchen the next day- but it never happened. We were there for four days. Besides this the stay was okay. The breakfast was a nice touch. It helped with us not having a kitchen. The bed was comfy. The street noise was bad, and the cost was high. I am not sure I would stay again, but it worked.On a sold-out summer weekend day (Saturday July 28, 2007), we found ourselves in big trouble because of a misunderstanding of the room type at the time of online reservation. The hotel staff went out of their way to resolve the situation to our satisfaction. The stay in this place was great.
This Hotel is located within a block of Seattle center/Space Needle, and is within a 2 mintue monorail ride or a short drive from downtown/ Pike Market area. The room and particularly the beds are very comfortable, and the breakfast is quite good. This is a friendly place with good location and plenty of free parking space.Great place to stay. Clean and nice rooms. Space needle within a 5 minute walk, monorail to downtown right there too. Good restaurants like Bucca Di Beppo within walking distance.
All of the staff were friendly and ready to make our stay a pleasant one. We were two couples who shared a 2 bedroom suite. Manager even took time to chat with us a bit. They all made us feel so welcomed. We mentioned a problem with our AC and by the time we came back from a walk it was fixed. 
Breakfast was very nice and they even had an ""on the run breakfast"" bag for those leaving real early in the morning. 
I would highly recommend this hotel.My family has always come to Seattle to visit relatives for a day, but we have never really seen Seattle in terms of Downtown and tourist attractions. That is why we came, and the location of the Hampton Inn couldn't be more perfect. The Space Needle, EMP and Monorail are less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. While it's not the nicest area and there are some undesirables hanging around, you still feel safe walking there. Just make sure it's not too late in the night. Also, right next to the hotel there is a new, big 24 hour supermarket which is very convenient. We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights, and we came to the supermarket at least 5 times.
The room was very classy, with modern furnishings, clean carpet, a second sink area with a granite countertop and mini fridge, but most important of all, the beds had nice white puffy duvets. The room was also a good size, and could have easily been mistaken for a Sheraton or Marriott. One clever feature we liked (but took us a while to find out) was that the closet was hidden behind a mirror! Very good for security. The entire room had a fresh, perfectly clean feeling, but one night we discovered two small stains on the bed sheet, but the sheets were changed every night.
4 Nits to pick: (1) The free high speed internet in our room wasn't working, and we when we told the front desk, they said they knew there was a problem with the internet in our room (so why was it not attended to earlier?). Anyway, we were promptly offered a change of rooms, which we declined since there were free internet terminals in the breakfast/lobby area. (2) The parking garage was clean and well lit, but the parking spaces and aisles are extremely tiny. (3) The housekeeping service had some glitches on the weekend: The garbages wasn't emptied; no soap of any kind was left in the room; and the air conditioning was turned on and the window left open! (4) The fridge door opened the wrong way, making it very awkward to access (see picture).
As previous reviewers have noted breakfast is quite good and has a good variety of items and a hot features that changes daily.
If you can overlook the minor inconviences, this hotel makes a really great place for seeing all of Seattle.I just came back from a three night stay where we stayed in the 2-bedroom suite. This was the very last unit (or first depending on where you start) on Roy Street. Because of road construction or trash collection, we were jarred up early with their banging and beeping when the trucks were moving in reverse. This was during the week days so if you're staying over the weekend you may not encounter this. Parking is ridiculously tight... and I agree with the other reviews in regards to this. I found parking in their garage (you use your hotel keycard to get in) was easier as most guests seemed to park outside. Everytime we parked in the garage we were able to find two spaces together that were unoccupied which made parking easier. There is a market, Quality Food Center, across the street (corner of Mercer and 5th) that was is quite nice."

In the past we have stayed at the Sheraton and the Hilton and have loved it. We decided to give the Seattle W a try for a different experience, believing that it would be on par with great hotels such as the Sheraton or the Hilton. Boy, were we wrong.
We are use to staying in higher quality hotels when we travel - and we are absolutely willing to pay a price for luxury, quality, and class. I can describe Seattle W as that girl with average looks and no personality - she can throw on a bunch of makeup and nice dress, but in the end, her personality still sucks.
OUR ARRIVAL:
We roll up and decide to take advantage of the vallet parking for convenience. We were shocked at the $38 per day price tag on vallet parking. We were greeted by the vallet with a friendly smile and he helped us pull our luggage out of the trunk.
Walking into the front desk, we were again greeted by a staff member who was friendly enough, but all business and rather uncaring. The check in process was quick and efficient.
OUR ROOM:
We elected to stay in a ""cool corner suite"" with a city view. The room was awkwardly layed out, but nicely finished. The ""city view"" was inaccurate. We were looking at two other towers on either side of us. We could see into one hotel room and one office tower. Our view with simply concrete, steel, and glass.
The bed was comfortable and the linens were satisfactory. The mini bar, like other mini bars in higher end hotels, are grossly overpriced. $10 for 1oz of liquor, $7 for a small beer. 
The bathroom was a little disgusting. The tile work was poorly done, and the finishings were ugly. The water pressure was poor, and there was mold growing on the shower tiles.
TRACE RESTAURANT:
The servers at the lounge and restaurant downstairs are friendly and attentive, however, I do not appreciate the cost of the food at this place. No matter how much money one has, I cannot see anybody apreciating having to pay $22 for an omlette, $18 for a milkshake. You can walk over to one of the other high end hotels and dine in their restaurants for reasonable prices and excellent service. 
Trace does offer a ""happy hour"" between 4pm-7pm where you can get a multitude of beer pints for $4. They were offering a delicious pumpkin ale that was just heaven. 
CONCLUSION:
For convenience of shopping and Seattle sights, you are better off staying in the Sheraton or other hotel a few blocks over. This hotel was ""okay"", but I would not stay there again.I've stayed at this property several times in the past year for business trips to Seattle, and I've found it to be hassle-free and convenient. Last week, this was my home for the entire week, and it was an easy walk from the hotel to my client in South Lake Union. There are numerous restaurants in the area, so finding food was not a challenge, and the hotel itself has a very good sushi restaurant. The sashimi was very fresh, and the rolls were excellently crafted. Pricing is slightly on the higher end for sushi, but the quality matches.
As for the room, I stayed in a ""Cool Corner Room"", which I believe is about the same size as a normal room, but gives you better views. The bed was comfortable and there were no noisy disturbances. If you're an SPG gold or platinum member, they provide you with water everyday. You get your standard set of cable channels on the TV, and internet is available for $15 a day or $35 for three days.
If you have a car, the valet is very efficient and gets you your vehicle pretty fast in the morning. The only reason you'd need one is if you have to go outside of the area. Other than that, there's a light rail that can take you to and from the airport a few blocks away.
I haven't had to interact with the staff much, but from my limited encounters, they've all been very pleasant. The lobby has a bar area that typically is pumping techno music, but it seems to be a fairly popular hangout spot on weekend nights and during happy hour.
Overall, good place, a bit on the more expensive side, but worth your money if you're looking to make your trip easier.Concierge is good to have put together a recommendation and map for us for things to do. The car was always available whenever we need it during the day. No service at night. They lack porters to greet you outside and load your luggages in the cart. It was also odd that someone brought us a fruit basket and water past 10pm and he kept knocking on the door. I appreciate fruit baskets and water but not past 10pm and not accompanied by repeated knocks on the door. The toilet had a clog too but they sent somebody up right away. Housekeeping also seem to not do a good job. Our bed smelled different on our second day there. Like someone else had lie down on it. It smelled icky.The spectacular room $250 and the regular rooms $189 are exactly the same except the spectacular is on a higher floor, the view is nothing special. Rooms are very average. Be prepared to have a hold of $250.00 on your credit card for incidental charges. Valet parking is a ridiculous $37 per day, plus tax. comes out to be about $45 a night, with that kind of charge you will have no interest in tipping the valet staff. You can walk through the lobby pass the front desk and hear a pin drop, no greeting and eye contact, everyone's eyes are on a computer screen. I think the only greeting i got was from the guy in the lobby marketing Acura SUVs. FYI lots of homeless folks in the downtown area. I you are reading this and you are the General Manager......the take away is pay attention to customer service.We were due to stay elsewhere but unfortunately our booking company put us into the W Hotel, possibly because there just wasn't the availability for our group elsewhere. The lobby area is modern and stylish, often full with non-guests which is a good sign. There is a bus stop outside the hotel, there's always a steady flow of people using the toilet or children playing with the revolving door.
The rooms are extremely expensive for what you pay for. The shower is more of a dribble, the rooms are dark and although they appear to have had a revamp, it's obvious that these rooms haven't had any significant attention for a few decades. Maintenance was also lacking, my room had a loose shower head and tap that came off when used. The shower curtain was just about staying up, the air con fan was extremely loud and impossible to sleep through and my iron leaked large amounts of water when used.
The water in Seattle tastes of chlorine, therefore I prefer to drink from bottles. The hotel provided one bottle of water for free and the others were $3 from the mini bar but never replaced. During my 5 day stay the mini bar wasn't checked once. The Internet connection is expensive and given the cost of the room, it should be included.Nothing drastically wrong with our 4 night stay here, just a feeling of slight disappointment relative to the substantial rate you pay to stay here. 
W has its familiar, muted colour scheme of course, though in this context we found it hard work. The room was really dark, we overlooked another hotel so there was little natural light coming in and all the lighting is discreet. It's impossible to do anything without most of the lights on at any time of the day. 
The Wi-Fi was an issue. It's a high charge to get it in your room, but free in the lobby. At no stage could we connect to this though, meaning basic internet access entailed a trip to Starbucks across the road. 
Lobby is stylish, service was decent enough...as i say, nothing terrible or anything, but felt that it could have been better.I stayed here recently for one night. We got upgraded from a wonderful king room to a spectacular room. If you are used to nice hotels, the W in Seattle is disappointing. It gets the job done, but I won't stay there again. The room was okay, and big, but the bathroom could have been in any 3 star hotel and had some cleaning / maintenance issues. A the towels were like sand paper. The lobby is small and has a strange layout, and in the morning they have ""breakfast"" there which makes it even worse. The hotel parking costs $37 and fills up fast, there is a parking lot nearby (self-park) that they do not validate against. Internet is $17/day. The experience was not helped by a party happening in the adjoining room which went on all night including flighting, yelling and copulating, which I suppose that could happen in any hotel. The hotel staff was very agressive trying to get into clean the rooms in the morning. The lobby bar is loungey (douchy) and the restaurant served some delcious seafood, but I would not seek it out as a destination. The location of the hotel is very good, right down town. All in all, it wasn't horrible, but I like to enjoy my hotels and I will definitely seek another one in Seattle next time.The rooms aren't huge, unless you get upgraded to a corner. The basic rooms are basic and small. It's the same W color scheme, which isn't my favorite, I always feel like they are dark. I did get upgraded to a corner, so I had more room including a place to sit and look out the window. They have redone the lobby - it was pumping out loud music at night. So if you are into the W scene, then you will probably enjoy it. For the money, you can probably find more value elsewhere...Our stay at the W Seattle was far from comfortable! 
In a short summary there was no parking available even though we were willing to pay for it, the room was extremely poor, the hotels complimentary lobby WiFi was intermittent at best and the customer service was non-existent.
The rooms are well appointed and look cosy however can’t judge a book by it’s cover. Our initial disappointment was on noticing that we had been given an Accessible. In any normal hotel this wouldn’t be an issue however it made our stay extremely uncomfortable. The 2 major differences were that the room door was extremely slow to close! This sounds petty I know but when you walk into your room and just want to close your door the last thing you want to do is stand there and apply pressure to it for the next minute so that it closes quicker. By far the most irritating issue though was the bathroom and in particular the shower. It had no proper screens, or barriers to stop water at floor level so whenever my partner or I would have a shower water would flood everywhere. To the extent that after my partner had here shower the carpet in front of the bathroom door was all wet. We ended up using every towel in the bathroom including face washers trying to dry the floor and stop water going everywhere!
In terms of the cleanliness of the room it was far from an acceptable level! So much so that when getting into bed we felt uncomfortable! The carpet obviously hadn’t been thoroughly cleaned as there was still dirt on it from the previous guests, and there were some nail clippings on the Quilt cover! Obviously this just made us feel great about where we were staying! 
After having a big day and heading to bed all we wanted to do was get some much needed sleep, but the room was extremely noisy. The walls between rooms were so paper thin that we could clearly hear the normal level conversation that the guests in the room next door were having, and the continual opening and closing of room doors in the corridor. Around an hour after trying to sleep and not being able to I called reception and requested a room change after explaining the situation and was told that the hotel would instead send security to our level to tell our neighbours to keep the noise down. This is the last thing I wanted as they were not doing anything wrong as they would only having a normal conversation! Finally we were able to fall asleep only to be awoken again a few hours later by our neighbours getting to their room and talking at 3am in the moming! We are by no means fussy sleepers either, it’s just the walls of this hotel seem to conduct noise!!!
All in all I’d say the only highlight of this hotel was the Complimentary Coffee available in the lobby each morning. I’ve stayed at a lot of Starwood properties over the years and would have to say the W Seattle is by far the worst I’ve seen in this chain.I can best sum up the feel of this hotel as ""modern sexy"". The lighting, the music, the lounge, the staff, even the elevators make you feel like you are in some highly erotic all-senses-being stimulated environment. Plus the little ""get lucky"" package (condoms, etc.) available in the mini bar in your room really defines its true calling. This is great if you are here on a romantic couples trip or date night at the restaurant. Kinda weird and awkward if you are there on business travel as I was. Seriously, I travel for work all the time and this is the first time we have had candle-like lighting and porno-type background music during the middle of the day at our table at the conference. It was hard to see and focus on the business at hand with all that going on. Staff was great, rooms small but sufficient, location is pretty decent although the actual street itself doesn't have much else going on. Would return for a sexy weekend with my boyfriend but never again for business!The rooms were lovely, quiet, and spacious. The beds were comfortable, with quality linens and supportive, but not firm, pillows. The staff was exceedingly friendly and the location was good. The ambience of the hotel is modern and slightly funky. I wasn't a fan of the limited parking space for the valet, but that would be the only downside that I encountered.This hotel has a good location and is trendy. It is a safe bet but for a good stay, however, unlike some W properties- this hotel does not blow you away. No problems, just creates high expectations. Delicious breakfast. Staff very courteous. Great as a base prior to a cruise or for a conference.We had a terrible experience here on Halloween night. Myself, my wife and two friends were having a drink in our hotel room at around 9pm. We were just talking and not being loud at all. All of a sudden security knocks on our door stating there was a noise complaint. We said okay, we were just about to go out anyways. A few minutes later security is back and they storm into our room with a woman claiming to be an undercover police officer. Apparently she was hired to work the party in the lobby. They said we didn't take the noise complaint seriously, now we had to leave. The woman even showed us her gun saying we would be arrested if we didn't leave right away. One of the security guys said we were with prostitutes. They are our wives and are both teachers. This was literally the most ridiculous situation we have ever been involved in. We had to leave the hotel immediately, and had to find a new place to stay. When we called the hotel manager the next day he said he wasn't able to comment on the situation. I think they are afraid of legal action.Great location, within walking distance to several attractions, restaurants, shopping centers and others. The furniture of the room is very modern and comfortable. Everything is nice and clean. The bar at the lobby has a great environment, very nice for a drink, specially on Saturday night. But the best of this hotel is the great service. Everyone is willing to help, to buy tickets, make a reservation, give you a recomendation or giving you an umbrella in case of bad weather. Congratulations to the team that make it so special.I just don’t get the W. After a sub-optimal experience at the W Boston a few years ago I decided to try out the W Seattle. Same experience. 
I drove around and around looking for this place at 11pm for a 2-night weekend stay. It is darkly lit – impossible to find at night. It looks like a small store front. Valet on a one-way side street and consists of a narrow entry to a basement parking lot.
You walk into the “lobby” which is blaring loud electro-disco “music” into an empty dark space with a couple of clerks behind small counters. You need to yell at each other to communicate. This didn’t work so well since they did not find my reservation and I needed to call the SPG Concierge (I am a 75+ Platinum member) and the concierge did not hear me well from my cell phone over all of the electro-disco “music”. The concierge informed Andrew (the front desk staff) that the reservation existed, and he entered it into his system. They had no explanation as to why there was a glitch in the system.
I had paid extra for an upgraded “spectacular room” hoping to get an upgrade to a suite. I asked Andrew for an upgrade based upon my Platinum status. I was given an upgrade to a “fabulous cool corner” room. (Seriously this is how they call them). I can tell you that there is really nothing special about these rooms at all. They are small and with views of the sides of other buildings – big deal. I had hoped for an upgrade to a suite, but looking at their home page it appears that out of 415 rooms there are only 9 suites, and being that they had not expected me, I guess the suites had already been given out by 11pm. I was told by Andrew that I would get 5k starpoints for my trouble, which will help me go find some other Starwood property to stay at.
On a previous trip to Seattle I had stayed at the Sheraton which is only a few blocks away. Despite being ranked a notch below the W, I felt that Sheraton provided a much better experience at a lower cost – and it is much more convenient to the highway. I am planning on checking out of the W a day early here and going to try out the Westin. I’ll use the 5k points toward a 10k stay. I will try to post something about the Westin, so that you can get a feel for all 3 of the Starwood properties in Seattle.I stayed at the W for 2 nights. When I checked in they told me that all the ""view rooms"" were gone so they would give me free internet. I don't really care about a view so I said that was fine. When I got to my room, I discovered my view was the parking lot across the street - about 20 feet away. I couldn't keep my curtains open because the people walking to their cars could see into my room. I was tired so I decided not to complain. I went to bed and was awoken by the garbage and laundry trucks at 3am. I called down to find out what was going on and the guy told me it would over in about 10-15 mins. The laundry door and garbage bins are between the parking lot and hotel. The next day I requested to switch rooms.
The staff was generally helpful and once I got my new room, everything was fine. I paid +$30 more for my room at the W than the Fairmont across the street. I chose W because I'm a Starwood member. I expect for that price I would get a normal room. If you are going give people the parking lot rooms, they should be at a deep discount and travellers should be aware. I've stayed in W's in New York, LA and Montreal and have never had an issue.
Otherwise, this is your typical W - great location, good size rooms, friendly staff and active bar.The staff at the W were lovely and professional. My luggage was handled with care, as I was unable to check in due to my name not being on the reservation. Promptly this was taken care of with a quick phone call from the person who made the reservation. The ""living room"" is warm and inviting and I enjoyed the ever changing variety of the water/juice station at reception. Everything was clean and well maintained. We had snacks and wine at the bar also with prompt pleasant service, even during busy happy hour. 
It was a nice place to come home too after events and the cold outside weather. The views from the built in sofa made for a nice distraction during the short periods of downtime or a great place to read a book. 
The rooms are quiet and the beds very comfortable. The location is perfect from the train station and close to the market. Everything is within walking distance, even in the rain.I've stayed at this hotel twice now at the advice friends and co-workers. Unfortunately twice now I've had my vehicle compramised while in their ""Secured Parking."" The first time was Valentines weekend 2010, the ""H"" emblem in my Honda was shoddily glued back into my steering wheel and, while driving back home to Vancouver, it fell out in two peices as my car interior heated up on the drive. The second was Thanksgiving weekend (Canada) 2012. I have a custom stereo in my car that I have my iPod, for all intents and purposes, permenently secured to. Now, as most couples can relate to, my boyfriend doesn't like my music, so we listened to the radio or CD's for the trip to and from the hotel, so it never crossed my mind to check for my iPod. As you can guess, it's missing. Unfortunately from what I've researched, this isn't the first time things have gone missing from peoples rooms or vehicles. I understand that the hotel claims no resposibility for lost or stolen property, especially since I can't prove to them that my iPod was in the vehicle for the duration of our trip and that my vehicle wasn't compramised at some point before or after our visit. I only hope to warn others who plan to visit. Do Not leave any possesions in your car, and check everything before you leave, it's easier to deal with the situation while your still there.We were out of our home for 11 weeks due to water damage and the only place in town that would take us and our two cats was The W. The location is excellent, two blocks from our building, on major bus routes, close to light rail stations, an easy walk to work, shopping, food and fun. The front desk staff and housekeeping were outstanding. The restaurant, Trace, and the valet staff are not up to par with the rest of the staff. We stayed in a Cool Corner room, decent size, large windows, comfortable bed and bath with Bliss toiletries. The WiFi and parking are expensive, even when an insurance company is footing the bill. The bright side is that we earned a ton of SPG points and can put them to use on other properties. Overall the staff went out of their way to make us and our cats comfortable on our very long stay. We would go back to The W simply based on how the front desk treated us, most accommodating hotel staff that I have experienced. The coffee, from Fonte, in the morning was excellent.The W has service issue starting with the bell staff if you can find them it's doubtful they will actually help you with your luggage. It took the operator on several occasions 15 to 20 rings to answer the phone. The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable. However the rooms need curtains as the blinds let in to much city light.I was just in Seattle for a business trip, 6 nights at the W. I am originally from Seattle and knew that the W is in a good location so was excited to finally stay there, as I couldn't justify the expense when I lived in Seattle. I was disappointed. Not from a hotel stand point, the hotel is nice, location is excellent, and the toiletries (sp) are especially good. 
The not so good in my opinion: The parking is ridiculous. I just submitted my expense report. Parking is advertised at $37, but after taxes it came to $45.15 a day. I know its the city but really I don't see how that is justified. Every morning as I went to get my car I had about 3 employees ask me if I was checking out. I'd rather hear, good morning, have a good day, not, are you checking out. It sort of makes you feel like they can't wait for you to leave. When I checked in I was in a lower level and I asked to be moved up with a city view. The front desk lady was very nice and said ofcourse and just told me to bring my luggage down the next morning and they would give me a higher level room with a better view. That was a laugh. I was given a room directly across the hall from the previous room I was in. I was dumbstruck so I just forgot about it as I realized it wasn't worth the hassle. I even pre-requested a higher room as my husband was meeting me there and it was his first time in Seattle...clearly that didn't do anything.
The last thing that really set me off was that on the last night we were there, which was a Saturday night, our neighbors in the next room were partying it up something fierce. I am not old, I partied, still party, but it was obnoxious. We tried to let it go, finally gave them a door knock to be quiet...but they were not getting any quieter. We called the front desk who apparently sent in security. They were quiet for about an hour when at 2 am, they decided to go for round 2. All in all, we were woke up by then 3 times that night. We called the front desk twice, mind you, we tried really hard not to complain as we know we've all been there, but they were over the top. When I checked out the next morning the lady asked me how my visit was and I said overall it was good except for last night. She said, ""oh I heard""...that was it. No offer of anything or apology, nothing. 
I think this hotel is ok. I will never stay here again based on the parking rip off alone, I'd rather stay elsewhere where I at least have the option of the self park for less than the $45/day. Last time I stayed at the Westin I paid $12/ night for self park, much more reasonable.We spent a weekend in Seattle before a business meeting and selected this hotel. It was great! We ended up with a room that looked down the street at Mr. Rainier; beautiful. The room was clean, spacious, and the beds are truly heavenly. It's easy to get a good night's sleep in this place. The staff was most courteous and very professional. Complimentary coffee was available in the lobby in the mornings and water in the afternoons. The workout room was well equipped and also clean with adequate supplies, towels and drinking water and cups. We highly recommend this for an evening in Seattle that will be memorable. A good location.Spent one night here before going on cruise on Friday, Sept 14th. I was excited to try The W, as it always seemed very intriguing. It was just okay... The location was convenient, as it was near to Pike Street, but the guest service was nothing to talk about. Just fake, plastic smiles that seem quite robotic. No help with my I-phone cell phone charger, as I forgot it home. When I asked, the response I received was just, ""no, can't help you"". No suggestions or alternative options. Not very hospitality like. The room was okay for one night, nothing great. A ""service charge"" or more like, ""staff gratuity"" was automatically included on the bill. Staff is already receiving a gratuity and therefore does not need to go the extra mile or exceed any type of expectations, as they are receiving this extra money automatically. Not a great concept as staff members do not need to provide real customer service.This was my first experience at a W and got to say was a bit disappointed. I have great things about it and needed to experience it for myself and got to say was not as impressed as I thought i would be. 
Postives: Great location... in the heart of downtown and a few minutes from Pike Place Market and great restaurants. Great and welcoming staff. A wonderful, cool, and unique lobby/bar/lounge. Great room toiletries (Bliss). Good lobby coffee but only offered for a limited time. 
Areas of Improvement: I understand they are high end hotel group but the price point for what we got in the room was dissapointing. The room itself was alright, nice comfy bed with a customed couch built in but the bathroom was like half-upgraded. I wasn't 'wow'd' by the bathroom at all. I was expecting a wonderful fully tiled walk in shower with but it was just a regular tub. It was like they half-upgraded the bathroom and thought they could get away with it. Also, no coffee in the room, why not? I dont get it, who wants to head down when they wake up with their lovely bed head and bed time attire to grab a cup of coffee when all they want is to have their coffee in bed. Also, I know as well parking is quite expensive generally in Seattle but $37 plus taxes, that almost came to $50 is a bit much I would say. If it was just $37, I am good with that when there are two additional taxes that gets a bit ridiculous to be honest. One last for improvement was that I dont get why the tv didn't swivel? It was stationed in one location and if you sat on the couch you couldn't really watch it. It was stationed towards the bed (yes that makes sense) but if you are on their couch you can't watch it head on without this weird angle. 
Again, not impressed at all especially at that price. I unfortunately will not stay in the Seattle W again due to these experiences but will give another W a try in another city but might think twice when choosing.I like ""W"" Hotels, they are always fun, loud and edgy - based on my experience at the hotel in Boston and in Los Angeles, I was looking forward to spending a few nights at the W Seattle. The positive - great location, right in downtown Seattle, comfortable beds and decent sized rooms. But to be honest, I could have been staying at the Sheraton, it kind of felt like I was. For the price a W hotel charges, I was looking for something more, a better bathroom would have been a good start or having options other than a ""standard"" bar (Trace) to choose from. 
All in all, I probably would stay at the Hotel Monaco across the street next time.W Seattle
It'd been 2 years since my last stay at the W and I was thrilled to be returning. I had been lucky to meet some staff members last trip, and was thrilled to hear from them via email before my stays. I got info from them regarding my stay and places nearby to visit, and next time I go I will definitely visit some of the restaurants recommended by them.
From the airport I'm told the taxi flat rate is $40 without tip. Add tip and it's almost $50. So I did some digging and found a limo service that did airport runs for $50 plus tip. I got a towncar with a very kind driver, and didn't mind the extra $10 in the least. 
Upon arrival I was happy to see I was definitely upgraded to the Wow suite. And yes, the suite does make you say ""Wow!"" The bathroom is huge compared to most and has a jacuzzi tub. There's a walk-in shower and quite the view from the tub. (No, they can't see in.) 
I was on the top floor which made for some spectacular views! I could lay on the bedroom chaise and just stare out the window. And I so wish I could've taken that chaise home with me- talk about comfy!
The living room has slatted blinds, and that is my 1 and ONLY problem with the suite. It's a lot like W Lakeshore only it doesn't have the room darkening shades behind the slats. So I was up early every day- even with a sleep mask I could feel the light. I guess if you didn't sleep in it, you wouldn't notice it, so I can't fault them. And again, this was the only thing I'd change. I had a fantastic stay thanks to the kind employees at the W, and waking up early isn't the end of the world. Besides, I had wanted the suite, and to me, a little light is no big deal compared to the extra space.
Now the living room had 2 sofas, a desk, a large leather ottoman to type or eat on, and a flat screen tv that turns into the bedroom if you want to watch from there. The colors were MY kind of colors, muted and dark- kind of a clash of color. The pillows were leather and the couches were the softest velvety fabric. A GREAT place to crash.
The W bed was, as always, my favorite of ALL Starwood or any brand beds. The bedroom was set away a bit, and though it had no door, it was positioned that you didn't see the bed unless you looked through the TV set that swiveled. Granted, I'm glad I wasn't with my hubby as I DO love to watch tv at night & an open room like that allows for noise to travel, but I was alone and the suite worked perfectly for me. The views are unbelievable, and I got such amazing weather while there! And the AC worked very well- that's of great importance to me no matter what time of year it is.
If you have a free day, take the ferry over to Bainbridge Island. They have wonderful concierges at W and an amazing ""Hotel Insider"" named Tom. He made sure I knew where to go and how to get to the casino on the island as I'd gone 2 years ago and didn't recall HOW I'd gotten there. It was a lovely ferry ride and I had a blast at the casino. I just hope next time I have more time to explore.
The hotel has the no-housekeeping option by which SPG members get extra points for turning down service. I didn't get service once and I only ran out of shampoo and conditioner, which they happily brought. The only question I had was whether or not SPG members would get water each day. As it's usually brought with the housekeeping or during it, I don't know if W doesn't participate, or if my turning Housekeeping down all 3 nights meant also turning water down. But it's not a problem as across the street is a Starbucks and a gift shop that sells water. 
It's funny that I miss my little suite away from home, but I do. I also miss all the smiles and Good Mornings and Have a nice Days...I could go on forever. Bottom line: It's a great hotel, classy, with kind employees who give it their all. The rooms are clean, extremely comfy, and had everything I needed. 
I will definitely stay at the W Seattle again! Total Positive Review- it doesn't get much better than that! :)Odd to not have an in room coffee maker in, of all places, Seattle.
We were informed that the hotel recently removed them, and NO, the could not bring one up for us to use.
 The wife was not happy, she loves her in room coffee.
Great coffee in the lobby in the AM, but who wants to paddle downstairs in their p.j's? Room service? Need to be awake to call, answer the door, etc .... 
 Seattles wealth of coffee is nearby, good news.
 Overall, hotel was great, as are ""W"" hotels. Great food t the restaurant. Don't pass on the cheddar biscuits.Visited Seattle recently for a meeting held in the W.
When I called to let them know I'd be arriving late (around 10:30 PM), they said no problem, and that parking shouldn't be an issue. However, arriving that late, I was stuck with one of the rooms facing the garage. While the interior of the room was nice, facing the fencing and parking lot made it feel like we were in prison. Also, the bathtub drain was slow/clogged. Very depressing and gloomy. Also, they had run out of parking for the night, so we needed to park in the big garage next door ourselves, which was a hassle that late at night when you just want to check in and go to sleep.
It took my asking for a different room after 2 nights (they didn't voluntarily let me know rooms opened up), I got a room now facing the street. Much better. But the early experience with the garage-facing room had already soured me on the place. Really, it would have been better without a window, and just a big picture simulating an outdoor scene or something.Poached salmon on Fall vegetables. Simple, clean, healthy dish done exceedingly well. Everything about my stay was great, but my meal at Trace was really excellent. Seattle restaurants are typical overrated (in my opinion, but I live in cities with a lot more choice and variety), but my meal at Trace was was memorable. Highly recommended.The W makes for one hot date night. Fantastic food in the restaurant. I can't remember the last time I actually ate the vegetables that came with my steak.
The Living Room is the reason we went there, great DJ music, awesome drinks and mostly beautiful people.
And a Fabulous Corner room with a chaise lounge, say no more.We just got back from a wonderful weekend in Seattle highlighted by the W Hotel. It started out a little rough as we were dropped off on 4th Avenue which leads into the ""living room"" of the hotel and not the actual lobby. The lobby was about 10 steps up and behind a fireplace wall but is accessible from Seneca St (perpendicular to 4th). The check in was fast and friendly and our room was lovely. The beds were really comfortable and the window seat was a great place for reading or drinking wine and looking at the view. We had a lovely sushi meal at Trace. There is always coffee/tea available in the lobby in the morning but there is a Starbucks right across the street. The location is central to most things downtown but if you choose to visit someplace further away they have an Acura MDX to drive you there! We had them take us to Pier 91 when we left for our cruise. A perfect way to end a perfect visit.My favorite hotel in Seattle, hands down. Everything about the hotel screams contemporary chic...the rooms are gorgeous and luxurious, love love love the bathroom, the view was stunning. The concierge is always available to give restaurant recommendations. The lobby bar is fun and the drinks are deeeelicious! Overnight parking at $40/night is a bit on the ridiculous side but well worth it for the close proximity to everything downtown. It is lacking from an amenities perceptive...no pool, no gym. Oh well, I am not there to do either anyway.It was my 1st trip to Seattle & I wanted it to be really nice. So I sprung for a nice hotel. My biggest concern w/ the hotel was my arrival to Seattle from the east coast was 8am. I put in a req for an early arrival & they totally accommodated me. Soon as I got there my room was ready to go. They placed me on the 12th flr while the view was of buildings the rooms itself was awesome!! I don't care too much about the views bc I don't pln on being in my room that often. 
The location I would say is central to everything, its a block away from the light rail which I took from the airport $2.75 for a 40min ride ""winning"" it was about 5 or so blocks away from Pikes Place Market. The down fall are the hills though ugh. Super easy to walk to the market but a beast trying to walk back to the hotel. Or I could just be really out of shape lol. 
I did take a taxi to the needle b/c a worker at the hotel suggested it but if its a nice day and you are into walking you can do the walk at least to the monorail which is like 7 blocks away I think and it drops you right at the needle. 
I also like the hotel b/c it was right on the bus line or in close proximity to a bus line I needed. 
The ultimate reason I went to Seattle was for the football game, and while you can take the light rail again its an easy walk to the stadium. Plus you get to see some cool bars/pubs and hang out with some locals. 
Nice plus I love when hotels are willing to hold your bags even if your checking out. They held my bag all day while I went to the game. I came back 6hrs later handed my ticket and went about my way.Great location in downtown Seattle! Fun 
night scene and great bath products by BLISS. Great views from the corner room we stayed in. If available, a south facing corner will get you views of Mt. Rainier. Trace is their bar w/ great drinks and food. Morning coffee always available as well as mint/strawberry water and the best iced teaFinding parking is probably the trickiest thing about staying in such a hotel. We are locals from Snohomish County, looking to get away into the city. Paying $40 for overnight parking in a lot is not part of the plan. Street parking is available after 6 and then you may have to feed/move in the AM. We enjoyed the stay. Pool would be very nice since it was during a Seattle hot spell. 
Sheets were amazingly soft. View was awesome. Overall though, not worth the $ for a return visit, but a one time splurge was alright. Won't be returning since there have to be better values out there.Geez, dark, parking issues? Well, it's true, they have limited parking but it seems to be an issue in the downtown in general, but perhaps there are hotels with better or valet parking, so if you have a car and need one then so be it, this is not the hotel for you. Otherwise, and even though I have no hesitancy to be critical when appropriate, I found this hotel to be excellent. Dark at night... but beautifully decorated, in lobby and restaurant.. and the food at Trace is awesome!!! Amazing brunch (pulled pork in polenta.. awesome with best side of bacon). Room was very nice.. was on the 23rd floor with view of water, very nice decor, nice bathrooms, great beds and linens, great service from all staff, and even though no pool, a really fully equipped gym, with fruit and tv's at every station and a lot of equipment so that you are not waiting around. I wish the Concierge was more available, but everyone at front desk was helpful and if you call before your trip they will make dinner reservations at very well chosen restaurants (""Purple"" and ""Steelhead Diner""). Also recommended the Zig Zag cafe, hard to find but our fav place to just hang. Overall, very few complaints, very nice hotel, great location, next to Pike's Place Market, in between the Needle and this beautiful park to the north (don't miss Chihuly Garden and Glass) and Pioneer Park to the south with the underground tour cool neighborhood with character. For our first visit, certainly didn't need a car and the Light Rail got us within 2 blocks from the Hotel for $3 each!We checked in twice, in two different nights and both times we were checked in fast. No coffee maker in the room as expected.. I simply had to stroll in the lobby to catch my coffee in the morning, no big deal to me. Water pressure in the bathroom just fine in my room on a very high floor. Wifi was free in the lobby for as long as I wanted. I didn't try the restaurant and the bar. Rooms were very quiet and my sleep was great.Upon entering, the W impresses with its stylish bar area on the ground floor. It's a pity that this stylishness is not reflected in the decor of the rest of the hotel. My room was large, clean and nicely furnished, but not really special or spectacular. As on previous reviewer wrote, the water pressure in the bathroom is a little low indeed, which wasn't a major issue for me. It illustrates that the W is not perfect. But all in all it offers nice rooms and an ok service in a good and convenient location, for an acceptable price.This hotel is fine... but I just expect more out of the W brand. My #1 issue is the water pressure in the shower... it was 100% unacceptable. My husband and I both have thick hair, so I suppose that it is particularly annoying to us, but I cannot imagine that anyone enjoys the trickle of a shower. Being green is wonderful, but not at the expense of having a decent shower in an expensive hotel. Next, there was some sort of feather topper on our bed that 1) did not fit the bed (it was smaller than the bed, so I was half on it while sleeping) and 2) made the bed way too soft. Also, they have blinds instead of black out curtains-- I come to think of black out curtains as a very basic hotel staple-- for much lower end brands. If you are on vacation, its nice to be able to sleep in without the sun waking you up. 
Pros: Location is good, valet parking is expensive but convenient. 
Overall, my suggestion would be to pick somewhere else, unless you don't care about taking a decent shower.I guess we should have known better, but the W is too hip by a factor of 100. I will blame the youth and inexperience of the staff for their lack of finesse and seeming robot like service. Check in was chaotic and uncomfortable. The rooms are fine. We stayed in a 'cool corner suite'. Our view of the water, was more a glimpse of the water. I was at war with the bed linens all night. The sheets refused to stay tucked and the duvet preferred to spend the night on the floor. We were provided with every gadget in the world...BUT NO COFFEE MAKER IN THE ROOM!! I am baffled by that oversight. There is a charge for wi-fi, which we knew, but in the 21st century that's like having pay telephones in the room. Breakfast was fine, but a deep fried poached egg is just a little too contrived for my taste. All in all, I am confident you can do better in downtown Seattle.Stayed here for 2 nights and had a very comfortable room with a view of the Sky Needle. The hotel is modern, very nice, and has a comfortable area near the lobby to have a cocktail and watch the world go by. The location is great - the bus line runs near the hotel, the train station is not very far, and it was an easy walk to the harbor for dinner and to see Pike's Place Market. The room was great, the staff was helpful, and I'd definitely stay there again!Beyond the great location and its trendy decor but failed to deliver when it came to the basics. 
The good: The room was nice and clean as expected. Location was perfect. Parking was easy. Staff was quick and responsive.
The bad: 
- Coffee tasted like ashtray. Not just the complimentary one in the lobby but also the $5/cup one when you order in the lobby. Save your taste buds the torture and go to Starbucks across the street.
- Ordered two chicken noodle soups via room service. Tasted like someone poured hot water in a bowl and threw some leftover chicken and a few pastas in. Super bland, don't order it.
- Be careful where you sit when ordering from the happy hour menu. If you sit in the lobby, you may find a happy hour menu in front of you but be warned this is only valid within the restaurant/bar area. The staff didn't inform us of this when we ordered even though we were clearly ordering off the happy hour menu.I am reminded of why I don't stay at the w . Good location but way overpriced. No coffee in the rooms and Oatmeal with coffee was 36 dollars. To top it off 14.95 Internet. Finally, I wanted to get red wine from the mini bar and it ended up that they didnt have any and I accidentally opened port which was an incredibly expensive mistake. I usually stay at other places in the city that have the same price point and have way more included amenities. Wouldn't stay here again. Staff was friendly though.I don't understand the appeal of the dark lobby, elevators, and hallways. If I wanted a nightclub, I'd go to a nightclub. A DJ in the hotel lobby? I would have preferred a way to get onto the elevator without having to go up a set of stairs. On Saturday night, the party moved next door to my room. Calls to the front desk at midnight and again at 3AM had limited effect. 
My room looked cool, but was not nearly as functional. The wooden blinds did not block city lights or sunlight, and were so full of dust that I thought it was snowing outside after I had opened them. In the bathroom, the frosted glass counter and stainless steel sink looked sharp, but it took me days to get used to the unconventional direction the faucets turned. The closet area was dark, and I resorted to turning on the bathroom light so I could see clothes hung there. The retro analog radio clock dial was too small to read from more than 3 feet away. None of this was terrible -- but it sure didn't match the shiny packaging.
The bill under my door on my last morning directed me to use the check-out kiosk in the lobby on my way out. The kiosk then directed me to the front desk. When I related this at the front desk, the young woman there giggled and said, ""yeah, that function doesn't work."" No kidding. 
Next time in Seattle, I'll stay at the Monaco across the street, where the lobby is calm and soothing, the staff friendly and attentive, and the restaurant feels welcoming and has delicious food. Colleagues who stayed here were very happy. The Fairmont across another street was also more appealing, has a great seafood restaurant, and colleagues there were similarly happy.Strategic location for a pretious hotel. Quite expensive. Rooms are great. Bed was confortable, restroom spatious and clean. Room service is quick and menu long enough to get what you want. Happy hour at night is a great idea. Best thing is the location, close to city center although Seattle is not that big. Sure you can get better rates somewhere else but if you want to play safe and have a great hotel this the one.We spent a week in Seattle in August of 2012, beginning the first leg of our vacation at the Vintage Park and moving over to the W for our last nights. Why? The very contemporary rooms at the W are relatively large, featuring a 12 foot window bench couch overlooking the city or water that is ideal for reading, wine drinking, or catching a snooze. There's lots of closet space, a large bathroom with all the amenities, and plenty of room to spread out your things. A key is required to use the elevators, which should keep some of the rowdier friends of guests away. We are a couple in our fifties but still loved having drinks in the first-floor lounge where the people watching and the service are great. The hotel is located near the financial district, a few blocks south of the main tourist area at Pike St. In just a few minutes you can get away from the zoo that develops on the streets at the Market and near Westlake. The buses are very convenient for longer trips, and there's always cabs at the door. Treat yourself by walking the 15 minutes over to and up Pike to the Pike-Pine corridor area of south Capitol Hill, home to some of the best new and innovative eateries and shops (such as Sitka and Spruce and Terra Plata).The W was a major disappointment. The service was atrocious, from the valet (I carried in my luggage without them offering, and they didnt even open the door for me) to the management, who just couldn't seem to care when I voiced an issue. Even when I checked out I wasnt asked if I enjoyed my stay. The Fairmont is across the street, and both the hotel and the service is on a different level. I would not stay at the W in Seattle again.we stayed at the W a long time ago (7 years ago) with a very good memory. so when we decided to stay in downtown seattle one night with my 2 girls, W come first to our mind. but our experince this time r really different. for the price, it is not worthed to stay there. the room is pretty small and basic. there r even no coffee machine in the room.i had been to 3 star hotel in different country (vietnam, indonesia, etc) and all of them have coffee machine. No wi-fi available in the room which was so weird for hotel this class and this pricy. and then the hot water is not really hot. my husband finally had enough and go down to talk to the people in charge. the only good thing is the manager was good enough to give us more points in our starwood membership. definetly will not stay here again, specially for the expensive price.This W was a very cozy and comfortable stay for us. Going on away on a long weekend trip, without the kids, this hotel was a perfect place for us to stay. If it's your first time in Seattle, don't bother renting a car. This place was walking distance to the market, shopping, and if you don't mind walking the stadiums. Plus valet per day is $37 (ouch). We stayed in a corner room which offered fantastic views. I do like the program that they have where if you decline housekeeping during your stay, they would give you bonus points on your Starwood card. Definitely would stay here again.There are not enough words to describe the level of comfort. From the room to the staff everything was perfect. The room was spacious and luxuriant. The lobby bar was incredible. I highly recommend this location for everybody.This hotel is well located in downtown Seattle and offers all the amenities of a first class facility. Staff is very friendly and accommodating, sitting area is comfortable, and refreshments are available in the lobby. Restaurant is very good, with reasonable prices.I spent three glorious nights at the W Seattle and I was truly amazed at the guest service I received. Every time I walked in or out the door, I was greeted, often by name. There was always fresh water, tea, or coffee in the lobby and often the most delicious treats as well, everything from homemade doughnuts & brownies to fresh washington apples! All the employees treated me with great kindness and respect. I had lots of questions about the area and the staff went above and beyond to not only answer the question, but always took it one step further to make my journey easier & more enjoyable. I travel often and it was truly refreshing to actually feel like I was going home when I walked into the hotel. This was my first W experience and it definitely raised the bar for me. Thanks to Seattle, I think the W is my new go-to Hotel.We stayed here a week, and expected a fancy environment with all the included necessities. We were mostly disappointed.
A. Disappointing:
-No free use of the computer in the business center (charged by the minute for the internet)
-No pool or hot tub
-No coffee/tea maker in rooms and no complimentary beverage/cookie center in the hotel that was available all day
-No room frig or microwave for our personal foods 
-No complimentary quick breakfast area in hotel
-Staff relatively unfriendly and seemed to want tips all the time; they did not appear to appreciate our business; we felt like a number and a price tag
-Bathroom sink clogged for a few days and new cups not brought to room for few days
-Hall noisy since doors slam with raucous BANGS early in the mornings
B. Encouraging
-Location: within walking distance to Space Needle, water front, and everything on the City Pass except the zoo (take a bus to get there, which is simple and low-cost)
-Our room was high and had a spectacular view of the needle and the bay
-Beds/pillows were exceptionally comfortable with impeccably clean room
-Larger TV screen with clear view
-Large workout room
-Secure building--you must use your key to use the elevator
-Bathroom toiletries special (Bliss products), but it is so difficult to squeeze out the conditioner
-Modern appearance to room and hotel, but almost sterile and bland
-Plush bathrobes were funWe only stayed one night in August this year, but everything about the hotel is first class. The decor is typical ""W"" and makes you feel like you are in a special place rather than a boring downtown hotel. 
And don't miss the crispy poached eggs with corned beef hash for breakfast. The inside is typical runny poached egg with a crispy outside.First visit to a ""boutique"" hotel in the US but have been to many in Europe and they are worlds apart. Lobby is very smart, very dark but when your eyes get used to it, it is smart. Rooms are ok, (Spectacular it wasn't) nice bedding. Bathroom is ok, toiletries replaced daily, towels have seen better days and we had to share a bath robe. No tea/coffee making in room which may be a US thing but I'm pretty sure I've had coffee makers in rooms in the US before. Usual expensive mini bar, you even have to pay for bottled water which was surprising in a room that cost $380 a night. Good central location, easy walk to all tourist spots.Wife and I stayed here for a long weekend getaway in August 2012. The location of the hotel is great because everything is walking distance. Rooms are a nice size with a great built in sitting area for lounging. We had a street view and not garage view so I can't comment on the issues others have. Parking is a rip-off just like all the other hotels in the area but the problem is that is it very small and almost always full. If you are there on the weekend try to find street parking. if you drive up the street by the hospital there are cheaper parking lots. Lounge is just OK. Drinks are not that great and happy hour does not offer much. I would defiantly stay here again because the parking and lounge don't bother me.This is a nice chic hotel with a great location in downtown Seattle. We checked in at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. When we pulled up, the valet told us they have no parking spots left for guests. We were instructed to self-park at the parkade down the block. Since Seattle was just one stop on a long driving vacation, we wanted to leave some stuff in the car (such as sporting equipment, cloths that have been worn, etc.) but having the vehicle that far away would've been very inconvenient if we need anything. So, we lugged everything up to the room. The parkade also has no in-out privileges or daily parking, so everytime we left, the clock started on the charges again until it reaches a maximum If you think a $35 valet charge per day at a hotel is expensive, we must've paid twice that on one of the days. I think that if a hotel has parking problems, they should ask during reservations whether you need a parking spot and reserve it for you. 
The hotel itself is nice and the check-in staff and bellhop were very friendly. The ""poor"" service rating on this review is only because of the parking and valet problems. The room is comfortable and a decent size for a business hotel. The location is great and within walking distance of many restaurants, the art museum, Pike Place market, and Pioneer Square. The space needle is a little further but walkable as well.
As mentioned before by others, in this day and age there is no reason to charge for WiFi in the rooms except to gouge you guests or inconvenience them to go down to the lobby or find a Starbucks.
There is no swimming pool at this hotel.We only had one night at the W hotel in Seattle, but it was a perfect one. We arrived very late since our train from Vancouver was delayed, but this was absolutely no problem. At check-in we were upgraded to a Spectacular Room on the 18th floor. Room was spacious, modern and the beds were so good!! 
Hotel has very nice bar downstairs (trendy) and across the street Starbucks as a less expensive alternative for the hotel breakfast.
We wished we could and would have stayed longer!I had a great stay at the W Seattle. I love the Northwest, and it is just a quick plane ride from Souther Cali, which is my base. The staff were very helpful. They helped with reservations and hotel rentals and many other things. I really like the decor at this W. Very modern and nice. It didn't hurt that I love Seattle and all the things to do there. However, this is a really great hotel and if you can work it in your budget, you should stay here. Really really nice place.I almost didn't stay here after reading the reviews, but glad I did. We stayed three nights for a combination business/birthday trip for my 18-year old daughter. The 25th floor room had a beautiful view of the space needle and every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. We did not eat in any of the restaurants or use the fitness center so I can't comment on those. Room service however was good, and the fitness center appeared to be standard hotel equipment. It was nice that was open 24 hours.My husband and I decided to book one night here so we didn't have to drive home after my girlfriend's 40th birthday party. I've always wanted to stay at the W and this was the perfect excuse. Valet parking was convenient, but expensive at $37. Check in was simple. We had a corner room, which was very spacious, and the bed and linens were excellent. We requested a City View room, but the 22nd floor isn't tall enough to provide much of a view (however, we could watch the seagull family raising their baby on the roof next door). Since this was my first stay in a W hotel, I espeically liked the ""W"" touches and Bliss toiletries.
Service was outstanding. Once we got to our room, we realized that my husband forgot his dress shoes in our vehicle, so valet brougt the shoes up to our room within 5 minutes. I needed a last-minute gift for my girlfriend and the concierge (thank you, Tom King) suggested a spa and offered to pick up the gift certificate for me (ready in less than 20 minutes!). The bartenders were top-notch.
We enjoyed a cocktail in their gorgeous and modern lounge downstairs. If you're not already a Starwood ""Preferred Guest,"" sign up and receive two free cocktails. Everybody can enjoy the free mini-donuts and coffee in the lobby in the morning.
The *only* disappointment of our stay was that their Acura MDX courtesy vehicle stopped operating at 5:30 PM (on a Saturday night!). The hotel really hypes this amenity (The Acura Expereince), but shutting it down so early is lame. Whatever. Fortunately, the hotel is centrally located, so we walked to our party and paid less than $5 for the cab ride back (in a Toyota Prius - gotta love Seattle).
The W seems to be a popular choice for folks departing/arriving in Seattle for their Alaska cruises. We also noticed several groups of young men hauling coolers up to their rooms (bachelor parties, perhaps?). I do not recall seeing even one child during our stay.I have stayed here several times. This is a standard W - The decor, amenities etc.....the service is OK. The style is a liitle more subdued than other W's, which is a good thing, and as a result seems modern with out being stupid ""hip"" - in other word there is a door on the bathroom and a chair that looks like a chair - LOL.
In general some of the newer W's seem to be trying to be a liitle too cool at the expense of being a functional hotel. 
Seattle is a town where you need a car (if on business for sure) but the valet is a little confused. The room service is good and I have eaten both breakfact and dinner in the restaurant. The food is good/ok and the service is as expected for the price point.
BIG WARNING ABOUT THIS HOTEL. All of the sports teams and/athletes seem to stay here as it is near the stadiums. Each time I have stayed (why I don't stay here anymore) there has been a party in the hall, a fight, hookers in the hall that lead to police and security - really loud and a scene. Not the hotels fault and they did handle it but it is not a pleasant experience trying to get into your $350 a nght room through someone being arrested.....This hotel has a great location in Seattle. The decor is modern and dark and this is one of the best hotels we've stayed in while traveling. Our room was quite large and we had a long built in couch along the window which was nice place to relax and read after sightseeing all day. The only con with our experience would be that our room was located on the end that faces the parking deck. We're fine if that's our view, however, the valets honk the horns of the cars they're driving when coming around corners and you could hear that in the room (we solved that by using a noise machine app on our phone to sleep!) Just two blocks from the light rail station where you can easily walk to and take to the airport for all of $2.75 per person. Just a few blocks from Pikes Place, which we visited for just about every meal while we were in town. Parking was $37 + tax a day, so we opted to return our rental car three days early, take the light rail to the airport, and ended up saving approximately $200! Seattle is very walkable so we didn't feel like the car was necessary once we were situated downtown!Dark and swanky, this W hotel has a great lobby bar and the standard W rooms -- small but tasteful. You can walk to the Public Market from here, and some good restaurants around. Menu, fitness center and all other acoutrements consistent with other W hotels in other cities.It is an absolute pleasure to be able to write a positive review about a conscientious, hard-working staff that pays attention to meeting guest needs. The front desk team, security and ""whatever/whenever"" staff here at the W Seattle just literally bent over backwards helping me print out and scan important and timely documents for work. Being away from my office in a new city, I had no idea how to get to a printer, forget about scanner!, in time for my deadline. The W staff did not even blink an eye in getting me immediately to all of the tools I needed (at no charge). By the way, their business center room was closed and locked for they night, and they do not have an official guest scanner...Truly amazed at their level of customer service and so, so, so glad I am not going to get in trouble for not having that document signed and scanned on time... :) Thank you!!!!The staff was nice, but the property is a bit run down. As others have already pointed out, if you are paying more than 140 a night for rooms here you are paying too much. I don't know why its marked as a 4 star hotel. I certainly didn't get any of the service that I'm accustomed to with a 4 star hotel. The food was iffy and unimpressive, the business center is tiny and you have to pay to use it, etc. etc. etc. The bathroom products are not hypoallergenic. The whole place feels like a mixed metaphor. I was on the 23rd floor and I had no issues with water pressure.From the moment I booked with help from Janey W. my experience was wonderful. Exceptional customer service from front desk, valet and room service. The location is perfect if you don't have a car- we started with drinks in the bar that were great, and then went on to a few other spots and ended up at a the 5th Ave Theater- all within walking distance (I was in heels and could easily manage! ) Rooms were very clean and modern. Thank you for a great time, can't wait to return!The W brand is about hip and cool. Whole the lobby and the bar exudes the brand, the rooms do not not. They may have a decades ago, but they Rw now showin their age. The bathrooms are nothing great, especially if you compare this hotel to other, newer W hotels. The rooms need some upgrades and a coat of paint. Way too many scoff marks and sains on the walls and carpets for this price point. Take away the Bliss amenities and this could be a newer Sheraton.
Something to be aware of is that they only have 100 parking stalls at the hotel. We showed up at 6 pm on a Friday and were told it was full. We had to unload the bags on the street and drive to the parade in the next block. This was also a problem when we went to leave as we had to park in the alley to load the bags. There was only 4 spots outfront and 2 were taken by cabs and the others but their Acura car service.
This hotel needs some investment to get it back up to W standard. I would like elsewhere in Seattle at this price point as there better choices for valueThere is nothing special about the W Hotel Seattle. I stayed here with my sister in July 2012. The end bill was close to $600 for one night and by no means did it warrant that price tag. The room was small and aside from some nice shampoo, nothing about it was special. There were 2 twin beds in a tight space which looked very similar to any other standard hotel room I have stayed in. Don't waste your money. The service is by no means exceptional (intact there was an air of arrogance among the front desk staff) and the rooms are average if that. I will not stay here again.We're entering the W hotel in Seattle on the Seneca Street Side (important to do because the check-in desk is on the second level!). We're greeted by a young professional staff who are genuiney attentive and fully aware that even though their hotel is a meeting place for the upwardly mobile youngsters that make Seattle great, a lot of their customers are a genertion older. And they respect that. Kudos. The lobby, lounge and bar/restaurant are colorful, an explosion of post-modernism...and quite simply what all of Seattle is about. We booked a Cool Corner Room, which turned out to be so clean, so spacious, and comfortably sleek and modern with the decor knob turned down just enough to welcome you, leave you feeling...young and ready to take on one of America's best cities. Naturally, there's a Stabucks across the street (yay!) and you're within a short walk to Pikes Place Market; a quick taxi gets you to the Space Needle. W is a great place to land on your feet. Priced a little higher than most - but well worth it. Please note that 4th Street is a major thru way, so there is traffic. But isn't that what makes a stay at a downtown hotel sort of ...charming?There is a certain level of quality that you expect at a W and I found it here. The location is great and the room very clean, quiet and comfortable. The Trace resturant was loud but the staff turned down the house music on request. Would stay here again.14.95 per day for internet - are you kidding me??? I feel less like a guest in a hotel and more like a college student in a sub par dorm. 
After leaving the comfort of a fairmont hotel the 'w' in seattle seems less than satisfactory ... the location is the only reason this hotel could attract guests for this price point ... 
Positive: Front desk was very nice.I recently stayed several nights at the W Seattle. I thought the service was great-front desk staff was very professional and helpful. My room was very comfortable.I was upgraded to a corner room on the 20th floor. My only issue is that even on the 20th floor I could hear street traffic.Overall, I enjoyed my stay and I recommend this hotel.Really? In Seattle? What a crock. They have free Internet IN THE HOTEL LOBBY ONLY. if you want to work in the privacy of your room, you have to pay. If they could figure out how to charge for the TV they probably would! Hotel is, at best, a 3 star hotel. Staff is friendly enough but not particularly patient if questioned. Rooms are on the small size. There are plenty of nearby competitors who do a better job.
We are currently staying here for several days, (this review is being written in real time), my employer is paying for the trip. I would not stay here again. And I certainly would not spend my own money. I would recommend the Hotel Monaco down the street. Cheaper, and they have free Internet.Not a bad place to stay while in Seattle. You can easily walk everywhere downtown from here. The rooms are clean and modern. 
I would reccomend using Priceline though. The original room rates are way overpriced. Rooms on Priceline are usually 85 a night unless it's a long weekend etc. 
If coming from sea tac airport you can easily take the link light rail and walk to this hotel.The good:
1) Location - downtown Seattle within walking distance to all the major attractions, the Washington State Convention Center, and not too far from the waterfront as well. Perhaps not the best location around, but you can't complaint about this as well.
2) The edgy bits - W has an edgy vibe, and is perhaps best suited to people with a leaning towards more cutting edge design and needs, and I like it.
3) Efficient & Friendly People - I had no problems whatsoever whilst at the W during check-in, check-out, and whenever I had any requests. The Whatever, Whenever hotline is really that - you can call them for whatever, and whenever ...
The bad:
1) I can't think of any other than the fact that the room I had was quite bare in terms of certain amenities - there wasn't any slippers in the wardrobe, and our toiletries was limited. It's probably because we were part of a convention package, so I'm not holding this against them.My wife and I usually stay at Westin properties. We heard about the W franchise through the staff at the Boston Westin Waterfront where we often stay. For our first trip to Seattle we decided to try the W. We were very pleased! The staff was great! No one was rude or unpleasant! Were there a few nicks in the edges of furniture? Sure! It's a hotel and not every customer has their head screwed on tight! The place was clean and the service was fantastic! The location is perfect! Easy walking access to amost everything and a short cab ride to everything else! We had a great time and would definately return.Happened to be in Seattle during a 20k person Microsoft conference - all hotels were sold out and we had to pay probably 3x the price that the room would normally cost. Wasnt too happy about that. Hotel was great - very nice size room, beautiful bathroom. No great views from the hotel - surrounded by buildings, but is in the middle of everything. They offer the complimentary Acura services which is an excellent perk to have, especially if you are visiting without a vehicle.If you have not stayed at a W hotel you don't know what your missing. They are just a little hipper, a little cooler, than a most hotels. The Seattle W has a pleasant and efficient staff, a cool bar and a great location.
Highly recommend.The front desk staff are excellent, and engineering is fast and responsive. Unfortunately you will need the engineers a lot. This hotel, while clean, decently located, and in the SPG chain, DOES NOT live up to the standards of the W chain. This hotel is in desperate need of a facelift. The furniture is old, it took 25 minutes of running the shower to get hot water, the in-room phone is from 1995 (photo included), there are no blinds on the windows - only shutters that allow the light to come pouring in, and the Acura ""no-courtesy"" vehicle STOPS running at 4:30 pm!!! LOL, what other W STOPS their courtesy vehicle at 4:30 pm?. This dog has seen its day. 
Beds are clean, lobby is decent, but as I told the front desk staff, modernize this PIG or I won't be back. I am an SPG Platinum, so I understand what the W brand is in other cities - and what it doesn't mean is going on a blind date, being told its with a super-model, only to find her ugly sister (with braces) waiting for you and you have reservations to the most expensive restaurant in Seattle (and they are holding your credit card as a deposit). Spend your money elsewhere.This is a great Starwood property. I've stayed here 5 or 6 times and always had a great experience.
-The interior is modern, rooms have been a good size, and a very competent staff. 
-The location is highly accessible to both tourist attractions and downtown businesses.
-A balanced age group of people checking in...above 21.
-Its one of the most intimate W Hotels, I was treated well even before I was a Platinum Starwood member.We stayed here over the weekend after our cruise. I was a little concerned after some of the negative reviews, but how bad can a W be? The front desk staff was excellent, rooms were very nice and the location perfect. We were not disappointed and will stay here again when we are in Seattle.A - list property and service! I highly reccomend this property for accomodation. I slept very very well, and enjoyed all of the ammenities in the hotel. The W serviced as an excellent venue for our girls get away weekend.We enjoy going to Seattle every 4th of July to enjoy this wonderful city and the area around it! One hotel property we have come to enjoy much is the W Seattle! A really hip and very comfortable property that offers a great location downtown as well and wonderful staff! As Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) Lifetime Platinum member i am loyal to their properties as they provide consistent top notch service along with great accommodations which this property delivered ! Highly recommend spending time in the Living Room Bar as the staff is very friendly, warm and helpful with exploring new and old drinks alike! We really had a wonderful vacation and look forward to returning to this property!My husband and I stayed in a standard double room with our two kids. The size was a little small for the four of us. The room itself and the bathroom were very outdated. Service, however, was great, especially their Acura car service. If you can, try to get a ride with Paul. He is very knowledgeable about Seattle and clearly loves his city. We tried the restaurant for breakfast, and had a great meal, although a bit pricey.I stayed here a couple nights with colleagues and we all had low pressure showers. There's no worse way to wake up than to a weak shower spray. Room cleanliness was also dubious as the desk in my room was covered in dust like it hadn't been wiped down in a couple weeks. The room decor was the blandest of any W I've been. Nothing special bed, bathroom, or furniture-wise in my room...in fact it could have been a Hampton. TV channels were not in HD despite the set in the room being an HDTV.
It wasn't all bad, thus my 'average' rating. The hotel is centrally located downtown within walking distance to several attractions and restaurants and a short cab ride to others. The staff was all friendly. The restaurant's breakfast was decent if expensive. The bed was comfortable. And it gets a plus for its tv entertainment - several movie choices of every genre, all in HD, with the ability to charge it to a credit card instead of the room. Too bad the regular TV/cable channels were not in HD as I mentioned earlier.
Overall, it is a pricey place to stay, but I think you are paying the premium for the location and not a clean room or a decent shower.
Would I stay here again? No.Very good hotel. Great location across from Fairmont. Rooms slightly worn, but still quite good. Staff first rate.The hotel was clean and the staff were very pleasant. We stayed the night before we boarded our Alaskan cruise. Had a lovely breakfast in the morning.
We used a miniature whisky and a miniature Jack Daniels from the mini bar.
 We were shocked to find that we were charged $29.63 for these. Nothing else was used from it. Absolute rip off. 
The courtesy car to the boat was great though.I stay in downtown Seattle every week. Mostly at the Grand Hyatt and the Hyatt at Olive 8. Trust me. Those properties are WAY better. This place is horrible. tiny rooms, I get a fantastic view of the parking garage so when cars have their headlights on you get wonderful night lights. (They offered a free movie to cover it, but I mean. who watches movies when on business travel)
So here's the thing. I'm not familiar with SPG, but apparently there is this green program where they don't clean your rooms or give you new shampoo. Anyways - I declined it on check-in. But for whatever reason, they kept it on. When you work late on business travel, the last thing you want to do is to come back to a room that has no new towels, shampoo or just basic house keeping. Am I a little messy? yes. but..that's the point of staying in a hotel for business travel. You can focus on why you are in the city in the first place. 
When I went to complain, I got about lukewarm support and even challenges to my complaints. 
Just do yourself a favor, don't stay here for work. The W's are cool and chic...but not very helpful for a good nights rest.It is everything you would expect. Clean rooms, nice beds, on the higher end of hotels. But nothing special. I felt like I was in a Hilton or marriot in any other city. Not that it's a bad thing. Felt the price was a bit steep but the location was nice, so I guess it's worth it.Great location in downtown within walking distance to the Market, other shopping, coffee shops, etc. Starbucks directly accross the street. We had a ""spectacular"" grade room and it was very nice. Didn't use the restaurant or the bar. Would definitely stay there again.My perception of W hotel is premium, modern n hip... It was none of that in this W hotel I stayed.
Good: good service, good food @ cafe
Bad: room is not cool, modern nor big
Ugly: the toilet is like any dorm in any university...3 star level w 5 star rate. Totally dislike.
I got upgraded to ""spectacular room"" n it was that. Can't imagine how bad the normal room will be. I won't recommend anyone to stay.This hotel is in a nice location for a quick weekend in Seattle. An easy walk to Pike's Place Market and tons of restaurants and shops. The concierge, restaurant breakfast servers, cocktail servers, valet, bellmen, bartender, and housekeeping were all great! The front desk staff~not so much. They must've forgotten that they work at the hotel, and we are their customers who help to keep them employed. Pretentious attitude and unfriendly. Hopefully that will change. Other than that, comfortable rooms and nice decor. I'd recommend this hotel to friends.I'm from SF and I have booked many stays at the W Hotels in SF and NY, expensive! This one in Seattle was a steal. Totally what you expect from a W Hotel for a reduced rate than what I know people pay in SF/NY. Great location downtown. Wonderful views if you on one of the top floors. Only one complaint, the Wi-Fi is expensive, come on W Hotels get with it, people expect free Wi-Fi.This hotel was really comfortable, clean and modern and new feeling and looking. Had minimum interaction with staff, which was all pleasant. Location is great and seems cantered to everything around DT core. The only issue was that the hotel valet parkade was full when we arrived, so we had to park in the public parking lot in the same block. this worked out great because we didn't need in-an-out privileges and it was few $$ cheaper. Hotel staff was apologetic about this but didn't offer any solution beside pointing us to the public parkade. Because we knew we won't need in-an-out, we didn't wanna push the issue. Great stay, will definitely stay there again.This was a special weekend getaway for our family and we wanted to stay somewhere really nice. With all the hype one hears about the W I was expecting a whole lot more and left feeling I would try another hotel next time. There was nothing terrible about our stay and I was relieved at the decent attitude toward our children, which is not always the case at such places. 
The rooms were what you'd expect at a relatively expensive downtown hotel. Normal size with a nice window seat. The side we were on had a nice city view but nothing spectacular, no water in sight. The bathroom was nice; good lighting, nice surfaces, very clean and great amenities (Bliss). There was an ironing board and iron which was very convenient. We didn't use room service or the minibar. A few of our party had coffee in the morning which was unremarkable. The beds were excellent.
The service was fine, check in took a proper amount of time, not too long. The lobby was really quite small for the hotel's size. The sign said parking full so we went to a corner garage nearby and ended up paying $35 per 24 hour period which may have been less than at the hotel's facility but I would consider parking costs more closely next time. The location was great. Easy walk to shopping, restaurants and Pike's market. I can't really complain about this place but I'm not raving about it either.The hotel is located right in the middle of the downtown area. Parking and restaurant in the hotel are expensive and rooms are not huge. Decor is similar to other W Hotels, very modern. Customer service is great and the rooms are clean and quite. Some rooms have a great view of the city.Bad things:
Parking was full so we parked in the adjacent public parking garage, which wound up being $15 cheaper than the hotel.
No coffee in the guest rooms. Had to wait in a long line in a small lobby in the morning for coffee. Free coffee isn't available anywhere in the hotel, except in the lobby, in the morning.
Room service prices were outrageous ($10 for cereal, $35 for a burger, etc.).
There was a weird stain on the couch... gross.
Housekeeper woke us up at 9AM on Sunday!
There's still a hold on my account, four days after my check-out, even though I pre-paid the room.
Good things:
Location - right downtown, walking distance to Pike Place and Safeco
Bed was super comfortable
Front desk staff was very niceIn the heart of downtown Seattle, this place has it all--great bar, location and decor. the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the rooms are big for a W, and very nicely appointed. I like the big window seat, the large desk and a spacious bathroom. These rooms have it all. The food is OK here, but it's near so many local places, you don;t have far to walk. Having a gigantic Starbucks across the street doesn't hurt also!Location, location, location. This W is like other W that we've been at: comfortable beds and linens, modern decor.My stay here has hardly begun and I have a glowing review for this hotel and this team of people!
My husband and I have spent the last month living out of suitcases and boxes at his parents house, as our bank gave us the run around while buying a house - we were supposed to close june 8th, we closed today, 6/28.
I was told we could get the keys today, so we headed down south to move into our place and camp on the floor - we promised his parents they could have their home back today as we have a new puppy and it can be stressful. 
Long story short - keys today fell through, we had already packed and made the drive, and we had no where to go. Exhausted and frustrated, we booked a room at the W and headed over. 
Upon arrival, we were greeted with friendly valets who also were sweet to our dog, an incredible front desk clerk who took note that we were a bit scattered (the tired faces, laughs and comments about having ""that kind of day"", and the fact that we both started frantically looking for our phones so the bell hop wordlessly ran to retrieve them from the car without hesitation) and some kind smiles.
We headed up to our gorgeous room (view of the water and space needle without asking - what??) and there was already a dog bed and puppy bowl for our little guy. 
Here's the best part. We called down to ask if they had Advil and tampons as I required them and my husband had a splitting headache.
What we received was two packets of Advil, an envelope filled with my amenities....all presented to us on a gorgeous tray of 2 gourmet chocolate cupcakes (still warm!!!!!). Written to us from Clare, a staff member, was a note that said they all hoped we feel better and to let them know if we need anything else.
I'm in love with this staff, and Clare? Your random act of kindness made a
last minute booking out of frustration into a fantastic staycation!!! Staff of the W, you rock and made this couple's day.The best thing about the W Seattle is the location. And I suppose that location is everything because you will pay for it here. I give it an average rating only because I thought the extra charge for parking, wi fi, etc. were a bit much. Otherwise the hotel is modern, comfortable and the customer service was above average.Stayed here for 4 nights in June. Everyone employee we encountered provided excellent service. Bellman read the names off our luggage and informed the front desk agent who had our reservation pulled up. Check in was very quick. The rooms are good, not great. The bathroom is a bit dated. The location is of the hotel is great. It's a short walk to Pike Place Market, the water and shopping.When Angie from the downstairs lounge/bar found out my makeup and phone had been stolen out of my car (my windows had been smashed overnight, WARNING when parking on un-lit streets even on main roads!) she sent up a cheese plate and a gift bag with a couple little trinkets to help me stay. She even purchased some fun colored bangles to wear with my dress the following evening. This lady is a complete stranger! The act of such random kindness made up for the horrible prior evening, and brought tears to my eyes. Thank you so much Angie for being such a kind person. I believe the parking attendant who found space for me in the 'FULL' parking garage was named Kevin. He promised to make it work so we didn't have to leave our {broken} car on the side streets that day. He was very personable and friendly, and went out of his way to make our situation less of a pain. Thank you to the W Seattle, I will definitely re-book with you! The hotel was a block away from the Pride Parade route, SO convenient! Walking distance to Pike Place, easy location. Book your next downtown trip here!
BrandiAll I can say is, some of these other reviewers must have stayed somewhere else. The W is a phenomenal property and has made me a believer in the W brand. What a great place! Their customer service was extraordinary, the hotel is quite modern (probably why ""Minneapolis"" felt like a bulb was burned out), and the rooms were quite spacious and well appointed. Every time we called for concierge opinion or assistance on places to go or dine, they not only gave us the info we were looking for, but also called and made the reservations for us. When we got to the place, we got one of the best tables EVERY SINGLE TIME! Are you kidding? I wouldn't stay anywhere else. They totally have my business and I'm looking forward to the next time we stay there. Outstanding place!I have been traveling back and forth from the east to west coast for the last 7 months every other week and initially I chose the W because of its pet friendly policy. However, I kept coming back because of one thing... The EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Everyone on the staff (and I really mean EVERYONE), treats you like royalty. The staff really gets what the hotel's catchy- slogan ""welcome to ""whatever, wherever,"" really means!! From the welcome ambassadors at the door and housecleaning staff to the management, this extraordinary team at the W really knows what it means to be in the customer service industry and they have mastered it!!
During one of my trips a few weeks ago, I wasn't feeling well and the supervisor, Jessica Parenteau, had some tea, aspirin and cookies sent up to my room with a note saying "" I hope you feel better Miss Shaw"". If you travel often, then you know what it means to miss the comforts of home, especially when you are not feeling well. The short story is, this staff at the W hotel in downtown Seattle really made, me feel at home and not like a hotel guest. That, in my opinion, is what separates a hotel from the rest.
I would like to thank everyone on the W staff and especially the following people:
Jessica Parenteau - Supervisor
Anthony Ward - Night Manager
Miles Schaeffer- Welcome ambassador 
Mitch Amort - Welcome ambassador
Jessie Chong (me) - AgentThis was my first time staying at the W, we usually stay at the Fairmont, but had heard much about it and thought we'd try something ""newer"". We checked in at 11:30 AM and were grateful to get a room at that hour, however, we were told it was the last one and a garage view, so not much choice other than to accept. Also told there would be some compensation for this. Apart from the ugly view, there were lights in the garage that the blinds did not block out during the night. At 10 PM we returned to the room and still no word of the comp so I called the ""any time"" line. Was told there could be free internet or a free movie, but talked them into free morning coffee instead since that was more useful to us. So I was OK until we checked out and I was told there was a breakfast charge on the bill. We also found the place to be very dark and somewhat ""worn"" in appearance on the hotel floor. They did a good job to check you in and out fast though in spite of the lobby being shockful of people (it's very small, and a tight entrance/exit). All in all the staff was friendly and the bed was comfortable, just not what I would call luxurious, and it is never nice to have to ""request"" compensation for what is under par and then have to decline the charge upon check out. Takes the edge off the gesture...probably back to Fairmont or the Grand Hyatt next time.Stayed in the W Seattle for 2 nights last weekend - The hotel room was very spacious and comfortable as we were upgraded (thank you W) due to a friend who regularly visits the hotel putting in a good word for us, to a Wow, King Corner room. Bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was adequate but in need of modernization. The hotel charges $15 per 24 hours per device for wifi within room. Gougery in the extreme in this day and age. They did reverse this when commented on.
The new much vaunted Trace restaurant, for breakfast failed on so many levels. Overly fussy, pretentious and ultimately we should have gone somewhere else for breakfast.
On the plus side - the hotel is in a perfect location! Would I stay there again? Only if the rate was good enough to prevent me researching other hotels!The location of this hotel is the best part. We had to have every light in the room on in order to see anything since the window faced a parking garage. That made things kind of dismal. The entire hotel, really, is never very well lit. The room was clean and very nice, though. There is a Starbucks directly across the street which was very nice. If you're looking for something walking distance to several downtown places, this is a nice choice.Surprisingly this was the least impressive of the Starwood properties I have stayed at in the last year! The W has quite the reputation as a luxury hotel and it didn't quite live up to the hype. Things were clean and the decor was a sleek kind of elegant but the Heavenly Bed seemed more like an old college dorm mattress and the towels could have come from a hospital supply outlet - industrial and rough. I know the dark lobby and halls are part of the look but it gave the overall impression like a bulb was burned out somewhere. The staff was exceptional or I would have gone with a 3 instead of a 4.Came here for a conference and stayed at the hotel. For the price you pay, this place is OK. It strives to be excellent and they constantly try to ""wow"" you, but I wasn't really wowed. Though it wasn't totally bad either. It was a lil less than what I was expecting since they put such an effort saying they are there to ""wow"" me .
When I checked in, the front desk girl couldn't find me on their system even though I made reservation. When she found me, she asked me three times if I was with them for the next three nights. I thought once was enough if she was listening (which wasn't as big of a deal if I didn't find out she goof up something else later -- covered in the later part of this review). The room--The bathtub drained VERY slowly so we ended up standing in inches of water as we showered... My husband did pulled the drain cover-thing right before we left, and it showed a clump of hair.. kinda gross. The semi-good thing is that when I mentioned it during check out, the people at the front desk took off $20 off the TOTAL bill... I guess that's better than nothing.
They are part of the Starwood Hotels, and I happend to have Starwood membership. But the girl who checked me in linked me to the wrong Starwood member. So when I got the bill in the end, I had the wrong address. I brought it to the front desk and they fixed it. 
The location of this place is great though because it's right in downtown. And because the room has a terrible view (parking garage), they offer a free movie or free internet for a day--so that's kinda cute. 
Also they were able to hold my luggage after my check out (my flight was scheduled for later so we wanted to be able to have lunch without draggin out luggage with us) so that was good service. 
In summary, the location is what made the hotel good. Otherwise, I think it's a bit overpriced since the rate I got is as follows: $269 room rate; $41 room tax; $45 parking--that's $355 per night. At that price, this place is really only Average. But say you get a better deal, and you total to about $250 a night, I would think it's quite alright.We had a great stay at the W. We're Platinum and were upgraded to a large corner room that looked over downtown, with the mountains and the Space Needle in the background. It's was a weird shape, sort of like a long L, where you walked in, then turned left for a long room. It's your typical W, very comfortable, all the regular amenities. Just a few issues - several of the TV channels kept going fuzzy or would go out completely (it wasn't even raining or anything) and we didn't have a blowdryer in the room. We looked everywhere, including where they said it would be, but it wasn't there. They brought one up for us.
We had drinks and a snack at the bar when we arrived the first night. The sashimi they have on the bar menu was excellent, the drinks were just okay (sounded better than they ended up being).
It's about a $40 cab ride to/from the airport, but there's always a cab waiting. The walk is pretty short down to the waterfront or to pike place, but Seattle is a lot hillier than I was expecting so be prepared. We found the location to be great for getting to everything we wanted to see.
We didn't really use the hotel for much more than sleeping and getting ready, but felt that everything was up to par with your typical upscale W.I was in town (June 2012) for a conference at the Convention Center and decided to stay at the W. The hotel lobby/living room area recently completed a renovation and it was looking good!
The hotel is convenient to the convention center (8 min walk) and only a 2 block walk from the Light Rail from the airport. There were many great restaurants around the hotel that you could walk to for dinner. 
I enjoyed my room and they hotel was very well maintained. I would stay here again when in Seattle.I am of the opinion that hotels in Washington state are almost always garbage even when you are staying in ones that are rated 4 stars. This W is one of the oh so very few exceptions with a great location right in the heart of Seattle.Just stayed at W Seattle. The room smelled like fumigation but was relatively clean. Checked in this past Friday and checked out Sunday. I have over 18 bites all over my body and it is starting to turn into a rash. I plan on taking some steps in hopes that my house will avoid infestation.Great location, can't beat it. We had a spacious corner room. Fab beds and linens as usual but the shower could use some modernizing. It was pretty quiet and we had set huge sets of windows. Ask for a room several floors up for a great view.I am a Starwood member and a huge Westin fan. I'm not a big fan of the W Hotels as the tend to cater more toward the common areas (and the clients drinking and eating at the hotel) and not the rooms. In true W fashion, this was the case at the W Seattle. 
Rooms were medicore and the part that annoyed me most was that the windows had blinds. Also, the beds were not comfy like others Starwood properties like the Westin. Everything just seemed below the anticipated standards. 
Also, had a really disapponting breakfast at Trace, hotel restaurant. Service was really slow even though the resturant was not busy and they were heavily staffed for Mother's Day.
During our 4 day stay the rest of the staff were very nice, but haven't decided if I would stay there again.Checked in early evening. Hotel is slightly runed down, not too clean rooms, but we were tired and only were staying one night. Bed linens were frayed, but appeared clean. The day after I got home, I found seven large clusters of bed bug bites on my upper back, shoulder area. Sent an email to the hotel administration, but never got any response.We stayed at the W for two nights in late May 2012. It's a nice hotel in a good location. The light rail stop is about a block away (down a steep hill), and it's convenient to the monorail and pike place as well. If you're going to chinatown, a baseball or football game or the space needle this is a convenient hotel. The staff was friendly, but didn't go out of their way to help or provide advice. The bellman did go up quickly to get our luggage, that was the one bright spot on service. The room was nice and about what you'd expect for a W. The view wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst either. One thing to keep in mind is that parking is $37 per night. If you have a car and are taking the ferry to Bainbridge or Bremerton it's very convenient for that too since the ferry dock is just a few blocks away. We would stay here again if coming to Seatlle as it was a good location with a comfortable room.My family of 4 syated here for a 2 nights before going on a Disney Alaskan cruise. It's location is great for 1st time visitors since many sites and shops are in easy walking distance. Just a few blocks from Pike Place Market, the Duck Boat Tour,the Monorail Station, Nordstrom Rack and much more. 
As an SPG Gold member We received an upgrade to a clean, modern room on the 22nd floor with a pretty good view and a long window seat great for reading. The consierge was very friendly and helpful. 
We love the W's promotion with Acura and received a complimentary ride in the Acura MDX to the Ballard Locks. That is normally farther than they go for free, but it was the morning and they weren't busy, so they gladly took us. 
Speaking of transportation, the city buses are clean and FREE until September 29th. 
I'm a big fan of Starwood hotels and W's in particular, and the W Seattle didn't disappoint.The hotel overall is small but the room is great and the Bliss toiletries are fabulous! They even provided a face wash! They have an arrangement with Acura and they take you to anything in the area for free. It's a little bit of a walk to downtown, but not too bad.We stayed at the W Hotel for a few nights after booking through Hotwire. As part of the Westin chain, rooms include the famous Westin bed....which still remains the most comfortable set of mattress, duvet, pillows and linen I have ever encountered in a hotel room. As far as the rest of the hotel goes, the location is fantastic, within easy walking distance to the Market and all of Seattle's major attractions. Rooms are spacious, comfortable, with cool modern decor. Our view left of an ugly parking lot and rooftop on the South side left a lot to be desired. We needed to call the front desk to have our mini shampoo bottles restocked, but they were delivered promptly. The common areas had a cool vibe...we used the business centre to complete a real estate transaction while we were there, and although the room is very small, it had everything we needed and an attendant on duty so that we didn't need to try and figure out the copier/fax/scanner. I'm always frustrated when hotels charge exorbitant amounts for wireless internet...I feel this should be complimentary in every hotel room, but the W charged per day in the room and per minute in the business centre. It was free in the lobby, though. The lobby left a lot to be desired - there were never enough people working, and always long lineups. The concierge was never at her desk so you needed to wait at the front counter among the long line of people checking in/out to ask for a restaurant reservation or directions. Once I did get through, and the concierge recommended a particular restaurant for dinner, saying she would text me when the reservation was made...no text message appeared and when we looked for the restaurant later that day, we found it had been closed for weeks. Other than that we appreciated the free coffee and water in the lobby although it was often drained dry. The living room space was a lovely place to sit and catch up on email. My daughter wished they had a pool but my husband enjoyed the fitness facility. All in all, we would stay here again.I had the pleasure of the 27th floor, what a view !!! The service staff was attentive...room service was very prompt...and the room accommodations very comfortable; the appointments were modern and museum quality...the lobby has plush seating strategically placed and the hosts and hostesses are anticipating your needs...Superb service !Well, it was my First Time in Seattle, and W Hotel made it very Special! Really! What a Beautiful, Grey and Rainy City! I shall never forget it! The view was Amazing from the 26th Floor!My family and myself got verbally abused and insulted by the staff member at W Seattle. I brought it to attention of the General Manager of the hotel - Tom Limberg. He absolutely ignored our concern and brushed us off. General manager of this hotel is absolutely unprofessional shob who ignoring customers needs and concerns. Do yourself a favour, stay somwhere else.Recently stayed here for a work conference. Everything went flawlessly. The concierge referred me to a tux rental place three blocks away so I could dress up for the black tie evening, the room was ready for early check-in, meals were good, the conference snacks and coffee were always well-stocked. The room was gorgeous with a nice view of Mt. Ranier, and everything downtown was walking distance away. Overall, it was a very pleasant three night stay.Just stayed here for a company conference. The meeting rooms and food service were wonderfully set up and the food was delicious. Hotel staff was very fast, friendly and helpful. My mini-safe wouldn't lock and needed to be reset from the previous user. Someone came up and handled that in just a few minutes. On two mornings, I ordered room service breakfasts (which were excellent) and they guaranteed them in 30 minutes. They both came in 15-18 minutes. The bed was so comfortable, I wanted to sleep in all morning. However, I did make it into the little gym one morning and the equipment was good, everything was clean and there were plenty of towels and water available. The lobby bar provided nice cocktail service in the evenings. The only thing I would suggest is to expand the hours of restaurant sushi service. Several of us would have ordered it, but we were not there at the right time. I would stay here again for either business or pleasure travel. It's close to the light rail which serves the airport and easy access to the freeway. The walk to downtown shopping is good. There are also ample Starbucks and cash machines close by.Stayed for a work event. The location can't get any better for those wanting to walk around the city and explore (but keep in mind it's a uphill walk coming back from Pike's Market... we can all use some exercise though). Check-in staff was pleasant. I appreciate the MAKE A GREEN CHOICE - 500 points! I see people complaining about paying for wifi... if you sign up for SPG rewards then wifi is free people! There is a beverage they have in the lobby during the afternoon that runs out too fast. Please refill it! It's delicious! My favorite part of the W chains - Bliss products and soft sheets! The halls could use a little better lighting (i know it's the trendy thing but it makes it difficult during the work conference to find the restrooms). Oh and the restroom by ball rooms need to be maintained especially if there is an event going on as it got pretty sloppy by mid afternoon.Very nice hotel directly in the center of Seattle.
The spacious rooms are nicely decorated and are very comfortable,the Staff is very professional and prepared to take the extra Mile.
The only thing that can be disappointing is the view from the room, so request a room with a nice view,usually they are flexible enough to get you one.
The roomservice is pretty good although not very exciting as at most W s.
overall a very decent hotel to to stay for a few days when in Seattle.Excellent hotel. Lovely room - I was upgraded to a 'Spectacular' room on the 15th floor. My companion was on the 10th floor in the exact same room except he didn't have the view ! The rooms are quite big and feature a very comfy window seat. The 'Memory Foam' mattress aids a good nights sleep.
The view from the 15th floor certainly was dramatic. The hotel is perfectly situated for first time visitors to Seattle. The shops and places of interest are all within walking distance. The Pike Market Place is a must visit !
The Staff were friendly and welcoming. My luggage didn't arrive for two days and the staff were very helpful.
If I was to have a complaint about the W Hotel it would be that wi-fi in the bedrooms is not complimentary. I was very surprised by this. Wi Fi is complimentary in the bar but lesser hotels offer complimentary wi-fi in the bedrooms. Let's face it - who wants to be sitting in a bar using a laptop - not exactly sociable, is it ?If you arrive by air take the tram to University and the hotel is 2 blocks away [up hill] $2.75 and save yourself $30
Staff were typically friendly and welcoming and my room was fine although not fancy. Bar staff were attentive and the bar food menu looked great, however having flown in from Japan my insides were in another time zone and eating wasn't a priority.
The downside was a stupid charge for wifi which I refused to pay. Why do hotels try to rip you off on Wifi which doesn't cost them much to provide.
Upside is an easy walk downhill to Pike Place and a wander through the tack [got to do it once]This hotel will gladly take your prepaid reservation, keeping a room for you. However, just try to have a spot for your car when you get there with your prepaid reservation. Sorry, we are full. Just park up the street...in the dark...with little direction or help from the staff.
Upon arriving, I got the usual lame 'we're sorry' nonsense and, although a Starwood Gold customer, was not given any opportunity to choose one of the amenities required by the program.
Clueless, phony and full of themselves.
There are a lot of much, much better hotels in Seattle. Don't waste your time or money here. And, do your friends a favor and tell them what I am telling you:
STAY AWAYThe W here in Seattle was pleasant to stay at and we found staff here very accommodating and went the extra mile on several occasions always including a smile! Ask for a corner room and you will be rewarded with nice veiws of the downtown core. The decor here is typically W chic, be aware the lighting is dim in the halls which presents an interesting atmosphere. No coffee in the rooms here, just head to the lobby where it prepared and ready for you to snatch and enjoy. Rooms include an the ""upscale"" immentities you would expect. Would reccomend this hotel.Is it bad that I wished I booked The Fairmount (normally where I stay) across the street when I pulled up in the cab? You see, I have chosen to try out the SPG chain exclusively for all my business travel this summer to earn points. We'll see how that goes...

QuietI've been staying only at Starwood hotels since 2000 & the staff at this hotel was one of the best I have ever had! Chris at whenever wherever was epic & everyone was soo accommodating & friendly & the valet/bellman were just wonderful! Thank you!!!The W hotel in Seattle is a different kind of hotel. The location is great, the price reasonable and the rooms comfortable. It seems like every guest has a PDA, I-pad, laptop, or smart phone. The hallways are dimmly lit, like a cheap bar. I guess when you are in Microsoft territory it is to be expected. The clientel are mostly young, and into computers.The hotel is within easy walking distance of just about everything in Seattle. The rooms are comfy with lots of ammenities. The resturant is surprisingly good. Once you get passed the "" uniqueness"" I think you will enjoy your stay.I was upgraded to an upper floor room with a view of the mountains and water and space needle between downtown buildings. The room itself was worn out -- beaten-up furniture and the ottoman had a hole right in the center of the top. Service was spotty. I had to call 3 times over the course of 3 hours to get a bar of soap. By the way, they are stingy with the amenities: ask for hand lotion, and they will bring you 1 tube. Housekeeping did the basics, but wasn't generous with the details and didn't swap out the TP until there were a couple of squares left.
Most stunning I found were the restaurant and spa offerings. $90 for a mani-pedi? Room service is marked up 66% over the already high restaurant prices. Frankly I did have 2 morsels of eggplant that were memorably delicious, but otherwise for one of those places that claims to know the names of every chicken that laid the eggs for your breakfast, I think they can step up the flavor. There are a lot of much better restaurants and markets right outside the door for a lot less.Updating my prior review for the updated lobby, meeting spaces, and excellent new bar/ restaurant. Excellent sushi and small bites, great bar staff, and great architecture. Rooms are wonderful, and the staff is exceptional. Thank you W. My hotel in Seattle.Spent 2 nights at the W recently, beautiful hotel, great service at the front desk and spacious room. My complaints are that there is no free Wifi, just seems like a money grab, and the rooms only have horizontal blinds, black out curtains would have been nice.I came to the hotel for a two day meeting.
Positive: the room was clean, nicely furnished and comfortable. The climate control worked. The front desk staff were efficient and pleasant. Service at the meeting was excellent. The hotel is in a nice location.
Negative: The internet access was absurdly expensive ($15 per day). Also, I couldn't connect without going talking to the front desk 3 times and finally having to call twice to some service person off site. Once I connected through the cable, I still couldn't log in wirelessly. I gave up. There is no coffee in the rooms.Stayed here for a night when my business trip got extended. The price was decent on short notice & also because the Sheraton where I was staying called over and got me a room when they couldn't accommodate my longer stay. The room was nice- about average size for this brand & had all the standard amenities. I was put on a 'higher floor' but the view was nothing to write home about. Service was good as W's tend to be- very personalized, etc. No complaints there. However, the hotel was undergoing renovations and the regular bar and restaurant were closed (knew this going in). I wouldn't have paid much more to stay there with the renovations going on, but I'd be excited to go back now that its complete and get the full experience.Staff was helpful. Walkable to Seattle landmarks.
Lobby is small. Larger area is part of the bar (which feels weird to stand in if you are not going to the bar).
No wi-fi which is just ridiculous and no where to really hang out and check emails downstairs (unless you are in Trace which requires being dressed up).
Hallways are super dark and trendy (which was kind of depressing). Rooms and amenities in the room were good. Thermometer had a mind of its own and didn't react to you changing the temperature. Room service was crazy expensive (which is expected I guess). Hotel binder still had the number for the Seattle SuperSonics which were moved to OKC 4 years ago...This hotel was not a surprise. Typical W hotel, with good service and nice standard rooms. Internet available for a charge - however this charge is waived if you are a ""Preffered Guest"". Breakfast not included in the rate, but available in the lobby restaurant. Coffee is complimentary and available in the lobby. Continental breakfast organized for a larger group was below standard and is not wort it. Starbucks is just across the street for much better value.
Short walk to the shopping center downtown Seattle and to the Pike Place Market (worth going there early in the morning for a great merchant atmosphere).Very nice hotel. Upto the usual W standard. Great location and friendly staff. If I could find one fault i would say it's certainly not the best W bar I have ever been too (its on the ground floor and seems to be lacking a little bit of atmosphere) but would certainly stay here again when I'm next in town.This is one of the few hotels I've been to that I felt like I needed to be dressed in the latest fashions to fit in. But I understand that this is the vibe that W Hotels are going after and I love that they've picked their niche and are going for it.
My wife and I have stayed at the W Seattle 3 times through the years and enjoyed our stay every time. I don't think I'd recommend this hotel as a ""family hotel"" but I don't think that is what they're going for anyway. If they're trying to capture the 28-50 year old, that wears the latest trendy eye wear and whose wardrobe is at least 50% black clothing, they've nailed it. 
The lobby area has a very cool vibe with a large sitting area and books to relax after all the walking one invariably does in Seattle.
The rooms are very cozy and most offer a pretty good view. All the design throughout the property has a very clean and contempory look.
The location of this property is ideal and pricing for the rooms is quite reasonable for the location within a major city.
I would totally stay here again but just need to do a quick run to Nordstrom first so I feel like I fit in.
Shared more on our blog: www.worldfamilytravellers.blogspot.comMy wife and 3 month old son stayed here for 2 nights and it was exactly what we needed. We booked here to enjoy the downtown vibe and local shops in style. Upgrading to the cool corner room was well worth it! We weren't sure how kid friendly the hotel would be but they definitely exceeded my expectations... Hot Water heater in room and staff was very friendly... The Acura courtesy cars even had carseats! The best part of the hotel was definitely the staff, Tom in concierge lined us up with everything we needed,Mike from bell was always courteous and prompt and the valets were all great with every request and Correct directions. Thanks to everyone at the W for a great stay we will surely be back!This week-end a friend and I had the good fortune of staying at the W in downtown Seattle. I should mention that I am in the tourism business - i.e critical.
From the door person, to the desk staff, to the bell person, the hostess in the restaurant and the wait staff . . . I kept waiting for a slip up, but no - they were all, each one attentive, warm and caring. 
As for my room, the decor was relaxing, upbeat and very contemporary. A bit European in flavor. Loved it. Perfect. All the latest amenities; a great big HD TV and an IPad dock - plus a number of other items looking hi tech that I did not get to.
The view you ask? I took a few photos with my phone (see attached). The Seattle Needle, the water front with boats going by, grand old buildings from past decades - just lovely.
It was sprinkling that day. We were going to walk to the Seattle Art Museum (Gaugin) and the desk person asked: Oh would you like the Acura car to drive you over? No charge and no problem. YES! And a delightful fellow drove us over there dropping us right at the front door. Paul.
Tip: Breakfast-there is a darling french-type cafe across the street with FRESH almond croissants and lattes. And there are plenty of restaurants easily in walking distance if you are staying several days and wish to have variety.
I almost forgot, one can not use the elevators without a room key. Just an extra touch of security.
Overall, I would give this entire experience at the W a 5+The hotel has amazing staff throughout and consistently. Rooms are generous size and well decorated. Loved the Bliss soaps and lotions and lush bath towels. The low light is annoying if you are someone who likes well lit rooms and Ambient light in hallways is depressingly dim. 
Lots of attention to detail to make guests comfortable and the $4o parking fee made easier to tolerate by friendly staff. 
For a special weekend or over night this is a great spot.I had a FABULOUS stay at the W for the past four days. The hotel staff is exceptional, the room was great, and location is perfect--right in the heard of downtown. The service really stood out to me--for example, I was checking in with a friend and we inquired if our rooms were near each other (didn't expect this as we booked separately) the hotel staff said no--but would you like them to be? We said yes, and immediately re-booked us to adjoining rooms! Also, after I left, I realized I had left something in my room. A manager e-mailed me letting me know they found it and asked for my mailing address so he could mail to to me (or also said I could pick it up if it would be easier). The room was really cozy, yet still very stylish and hip! I just had a standard room with a King bed but it came with a wall long couch too. The room also came with a place to plug in your ipod and play music, TV, and a DVD player (which is nice for longer stays as it seems silly to pay so much for the pay per view movies). I love all the Bliss products in the bathroom and the bathroom was very chic and modern. Oh, and the hotel bar/restaurant Trace was excellent. Very yummy drinks and a good late night happy hour! I would highly recommend this hotel!Hubby and I stayed here for two nights over the Black Friday weekend... we pretty much just slept at the hotel... we spent much of our time shopping or eating out.. Our room was in a high-level floor and we had an nice view of the city... bathroom was nice and clean.. bed was comfortable... The hotel is very nice! I can't really comment on any other services as we didnt really eat there or interacted much with staff other than check/in check/outSo I didn't know that the W Seattle was undergoing serious renovation to the lobby, bar and restaurant. Had I known, I probably wouldn't have chosen to stay here. Not the fault of the hotel but of the conference organisers who booked the W as part of their package. So with this caveat.....
Very friendly staff, mostly helpful but not so much when I asked them why the bar was closed at 10pm. They had a makeshift bar and restaurant in the hotel. They made a great fuss about handing out this schedule on check in. In my room they had left a message for me to contact the front desk to ensure that I had received the schedule. But it was worthless. The bar closing time was midnight on the schedule but in reality, they were closing it whenever they wanted. What's was the point of the schedule? 
Anyway....the room was good, nice smellies in the bathroom. Terrible view but it was away from the street and so relatively quiet. Nothing else to report really as I didn't really use any of the services. 
At the conference rate, the hotel would have been a good deal had all the facilities been in place. Without these I would not want to stay there again.I had the pleasure of five days at the W in Seattle courtesy of a business trip and i found it to be excellent. Working from the hotel room can be a chore but not when it is spacious, well equipped and comfortable. The hotel staff are super friendly without being smarmy and are very willing to help. Room service, while expensive, is excellent and the well equipped mini bar and goody station is a massive temptation -- but be warned, it is super pricey! The beds as always in the W are wonderfully comfortable and make for great sleep. My only minor gripe is that the shower could do with more pressure but in a stylish and large bathroom, that's me getting picky. Overall I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.Read some not so flattering reviews of W Seattle. Not sure why. Usually stay at the Grand Hyatt when in Seattle, but had a great stay here this past weekend. 
Room was spacious and comfortable. Bed was super comfy. Bar Scene was very happening both nights we were there. Food was pretty good in both the bar and restaurant. 
Front Desk Staff was very attentive and pleasant during a busy check-in process. Ordered Room service and it came quickly. Had a bunch of gear from a shoot and the bellman arrived shortly after calling and hauled it all down to my car service out front of the hotel.
Nice touch of changing the floor mats in the elevator throughout the day, Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening. Love those little nuances. Will be back in the future.The W Seattle is very smart and clean, and the room I was given was very comfortable. There seems to be a reputation about the beds at the W being good, and it's true, they are a joy to sleep in.
I didn't eat in the restaurant as it was too expensive for me, but the free coffee in the lobby every morning was welcomed, it made up for the fact that there was no coffee maker in the guest room, which disappointed me at first. But I was happy to make a trip down to the lobby in the morning - which was also where you could get free wifi. Staff at the desk were very helpful. I would be happy to stay here again.Had the choice of the W, Sheraton, or the Westin all within a few blocks. Thought I would try to be wowed by the W but instead was found myself at the S for standard hotel experience. The staff was great. The lobby was being renovated, and went past the date posted on their website. There is no spa at this hotel, the gym is the super small. I would consider giving them another shot once the lobby opens and they have a proper bar and restaurant to wow me at.I stayed here with my 21 year old daughter for a girl's weekend in Seattle. We had never stayed in a W, and we both loved it! We thought the price was very fair for a great city location within walking distance of many restaurants and two Starbucks. My daughter and I loved the cool, hip atmosphere and special touches such as flavored water & morning coffee in the lobby. I'm not sure why others have complained about the rooms. Our room with double beds was very clean, spacious, and stocked with spa-like robes and Bliss bath products/shampoos. Everything looked pretty new, with upscale trendy decor. The Westin Heavenly Beds were plush and very comfortable. Parking is expensive in a nearby garage, but that's typical for all downtown hotels. Once we parked, we never needed to drive our car since we were able to walk whereever we wanted to go. It's located in the bus ""free zone"" so you can hop on a free bus and get closer to many popular destinations such as Westlake & Pacific Place shopping centers. Walking to Pike Place Market is possible (about 6 city blocks away), or shorten your walk by riding the free bus for a couple blocks and get off near Pike Street. (Unless you know what you're doing, be careful not to take one of the long ""express"" buses, since they don't make as many stops). I highly recommend the Purple Cafe & Wine Bar which is only a block away. The food was great and the ample selection of wine flights which is a fun way to try several good wines. The W is definitely not for everyone, especially not for young children, not for elderly, and not for anyone wanting lots of amenities and pampering. I highly recommend the W Seattle if you are wanting a great central city location and a unique hotel experience.Best W I have stayed in by far. London is ok........all 5 W's I have stayed in in New York are cramped with horrible bathrooms, although the staff is excellent. The Boston and San Diego W are ok, but the Seattle W is everything the W wants to be, but maybe only Seattle can be. Cool, friendly, and happy about it. upgrading to a corner, higher floor room is a good idea, which is what I did the 3 times I stayed there, with a view of the water, the ferries, the Space Needle, and Mt. Rainier from one of the rooms. My stay was in June 2010, and I understand there are rennovations, thus to not be put off on this W, perhaps wait til it is over. The gym is well equipped, and since it is in Seattle, and not in Milan, is filled with friendly people and staff, as is the entire hotel. The serve yourself iced, flavored waters and choice of coffees in the lobby for takeaway is a very nice touch...very Seattle, very W. maybe it is the combination. I traveled in 2010, but this option was not available so I put April 2011.........so, I would say you should take my review with a grain of salt....but, I am a seasoned W traveler.i really enjoyed my stay at thies hotel located a few steps from central pine market except :
- the entrance door in angle and next to parking entrance
- water leaks in the shower
but excellent food
excellent and helpful staff...The headline says it all. The room, the service, the food. All top notch. Our room was really nice and the view was to die for. They went above and beyond for service from the day we first checked in, until the night we left. The restaurant and lounge was very new yorky and fun. The food was a bit pricey but very good. We'll definitely stay here again when we're back in town.Expected more from hotel in this category. Place looks good, misses the mark otherwise. No coffee provided in room. Front desk staff pleasant but distant. WiFi charge was $14.95 per day during our three nights. Stayed in three hotels this trip. The other two have asked for comments, not this one.I am writing this review for the people who think customer service is gone! A young man named Jada at the W hotel in Seattle should teach everyone about customer service! I called to make a reservation for my sons wedding night and Jada took care of everything! He made sure that it will be a special night.Thw W hotel is the place to stay in Seattle! The location is great and the hotel is fantastic! Top all of this off with the best customer service in Seattle and this is a must stay for everyone when coming to Seattle! Every hotel should have a Jada! Thanks!I checked into my room and pretty much went to sleep. In the morning I noticed how dirty the bathroom was. The floor was dirty, the coasters had water stains on them, there was mold between the glass basin and the metal supports, and the grout in the bath was also moldy. The towels were tattered and stained and there were plastic disposable cup. Definitely nothing like I had experienced with the W brand previously. On the upside the bed was great.They are going through renovations and so the restaurant is not available. Use to be an excellent place to eat. I hope the quality returns when the work is completed. My biggest complaint is the noise from the street. It travels right up the building and you can hear all the noise, cars and sirens. The building itself feels dark and depressing as are the rooms.I've stayed here a number of times over the years. Nothing much has changed, it's very comfortable, swish and upmarket but the entire reception and bar area has been demolished removing one of the best things about the hotel (incl. the amazing sexy fries).
I'd avoid until the bar is reopened unless your not fussed about that.
Customer service as usual is a little transactional, the four seasons Seattle shows how service should be doneI spent two nights at the W Seattle this past weekend. I have to admit it was not a good stay. To begin with, I entered the address in my GPS. When it said I had arrived at my destination, I couldn't find it. The hotel lobby is undergoing renovation and there's no markings to say the entrance was around the corner on Senecca and the only sign I finally found (after driving around the block again) was the unlit W plaque. As others have mentioned, the lobby is undergoing renovation and it should be completed within a few more weeks. Hopefully that will improve the visibility issue.
My room was nice. An upper floor corner room with floor-to-ceiling windows. A nice view of the library and the city. The room was comfortable but there was a big white spot on the night stand next to the bed that could have easily been buffed out (it was just wax from someone setting something wet on it). In addition, the wi-fi didn't work in the room. I called the front desk and they connected me with their off-site IT department. They were able to fix the problem for a little while but I ended up making another call the next day again for the same problem.
Be sure to check you bill before checking out. Remember having to contact the IT department a second time? When the front desk connected me with them, they charged me for the phone call! They also charged me for room service I ordered that I had paid cash for! The front desk said they would back out the charges but couldn't print a receipt for me. They e-mailed one to me but instead of backing out the charges, they billed me a second time for them! Thank goodness for American Express. I just called them and they'll deal with it.
Hopefully things will improve. I talked to SPG corporate customer service this morning (I'm a SPG Platinum member) and they set up a file on it but I doubt I'll stay here again. Next time I'm back in Seattle I'll go back to the Westin, which was my first choice but was sold out for one of the nights I was in town.My husband and I have stayed here on several occasions. We live in Seattle but this is our favorite in town getaway. They have a great bar, with excellent drinks. I have had great service everytime I have been there. It is a little dark in the hallways but I feel like that is a W thing that is common with most W's. My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and somehow somone found out and they sent us chocolate cover strawberries, a very nice touch on our special evening. The only downfall is vallet parking there is 50 dollars!!! but for an every once in awhile spludge its ok but if you are comoing from out of town i would recomend getting a taxi here. The location is excellent, it is walking distance to everything: shopping, Pike Place Market, and the Stadiums. I highly recomend this hotel.Great location, good food and pleasant rooms. Walkable to many good restaurants, museums, Pikes Market and coffee shops. I've never seen so many coffee stores in one location. Seemed like there was one (or two) every block. The hotel is also right next door to the library designed by Rem Koolhaas. Quite amazing. I would return.The hotel was just ok. It wasn't good and it wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't an amazing stay. I sort of felt like I had traveled back in time to the 90's with the decor and lighting. We had an issue with check-in and the hotel manager wasn't exactly warm, fuzzy or accomodating. I mostly just felt like she didn't care whether we stayed or left. We did eventually get the check-in figured out, but when we were on our way up to our room, another staff member we ran into in the elevator mentioned that the the manager was a ""peach"". I think having a manager that's not very service oriented says a lot about a hotel. I probably won't stay here again, just because I think I could stay somewhere more interesting and enjoyable for the price.My sister and I went to Seattle for a sister weekend trip and stayed at the W. Like all the other reviews mentioned, they are currently going through a renovation. However, the service is still great. Our check in was smooth and they upgraded us to a superior room. There were coffee and yummy donuts in the am and water/ice tea and cookies in the pm for us to snack on. On our last day, they helped us check in and print our boarding pass for our flight back home. We had a great stay. The only complain I have is that they did not re-supply the bath products after our first night. Not a big deal though.I can only comment on the rooms, the temporary lobby and the service. To me this W seems like a renovation of a previous, traditional hotel. We did get the fabulous corner room on a top floor, 22nd. I love the floor to ceiling windows on the corner and sat in the chaise looking out at the buildings, park and traffic for glorious hours. That's what I do when I leave my small town home.
We did have a view of the beautiful city library but not the water unfortunately. We stayed five days and got to know many of the staff. They were good to great. One that stood out was Micheal who floated around the front desk. He introduced himself. Got to know us but didn't linger. He always asked if I wanted juice for our baby, water and even made sure I had a bag to carry it all in. Every time we saw him. He jumped to it. I call it the W hustle and he had it.
The lobby had coffee and donuts every morning and beautiful cookies every afternoon. Maybe because of the reno's. Wifi was also free in our rooms because of it. That pleased me. I hate when they still charge you for everything even though the services are limited. It was the lobby and restaurant that were being renovated. They had a temporary restaurant which I also appreciated. My husband needed it in the morning when the baby was still getting up too early for me.
The location is nice, near the water, Pike Place market and shopping. I tried a lot of the local restaurants and had some amazing food.
Shuckers next door is good for a cocktail and oysters. Nice old, wood bar with atmosphere in the old Olympia hotel, now the Fairmont. Also in this hotel is the amazing Belle Epoque (I think) a french bakery. This is a must. Coffee and pastries are amazing. I also had a Croque Mousier for breakfast and might say it was the best thing I ate in Seattle. 
We went to Spur Gastropub for Valentines day and though it was tasty, they didn't serve enough food or drink in the set menu and at $85 for food and $40 for wine it was just too much for what it was. Cool place and atmosphere and maybe the regular menu is great. I would try again.
I would stay here again, I just can't wait to be able to use the restaurant and bar. I always miss them when they are under construction! It was New Orleans French Quarter last time.
One minus: parking is $45 a day. it's so convenient that we did it but felt it was a bit pricey.First, I conducted a cocktail and dinner event last night for 145 customers and cannot offer sufficient praise to the event banquet and a/v teams. They did an outstanding job and would consider the property again for a business function. That said, one of the main attractions to W Hotels are the fun public spaces. Everything here is being renovated and meals and cocktails must all be taken in makeshift hotel banquet rooms... no character whatsover. With the construction, room service becomes the more appealing meal option, but it is a ripoff. Here's a quote from the room service menu (when public options are all under construction).... ""...Please note a 23% service charge and a $4.00 delivery charge is added to the bill. Included in the 23% service charge is a 17% charge that is paid directly to the employee(s) providing the service. No portion of the delivery charge is paid directly to the employees."" They got the room service order wrong and I had to call the front desk to request soap. Now that I know there is a Kimpton property right across the street, I'll be there next time... Hotel Monaco. Again, great for a meeting event, but not a good choice for sleeping rooms and no branded W experience in the public areas at all.Special thanks to Jake and the staff at the W that made my business stay ridiculously awesome.
I stayed in a Fantastic on the top floor, and had an amazing view of the space needle. The staff here went out of their way to make my stay perfect. 
I will definitely stay here every time I come back to Seattle.There are many reasons to like the w. I love the lobby bar and the constant flow of people and events out of this downtown Seattle location. The drinks never disappoint and the vibe is very cool. The rooms are nice although a little on the small size. Make sure you are above the parking garage as light and noise may effect your sleep but if above the views can be quite dramatic.It was my first time staying at the W Seattle. Normally, we would stay at the Westin or Sheraton (we're SPG members), when we're in Seattle, but decided to try somewhere different. Imagine my surprise when we got there. Though the hotel is undergoing some renovations till the end of February, it still made for a nice weekend stay. They relocated the restaurant and lounge to the 2nd floor, but a very small area was set aside for them. We chose to eat out instead for the time we were there. The hotel is located in the financial district, but you are close enough other restaurants by a block or 2, that you can walk.
We were there for an anniversary and they upgraded us to a corner suite which was wonderful! The room was more than enough for the 2 of us. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. I would definitely be back to stay here, once the renovations are done. And did I mention they are close to Pike Place Market?I am definitely a fan of the W, but if I wasn't paying Starwood Points for this hotel, it might be a little lower. We arrived on the weekend, and got a small box room for our platinum upgrade, which was slightly confusing. It was no different than any other, but they said it was one of their superior rooms. But, to the hotel's credit, they allowed us to change rooms to a lower floor that was a corner view, which was very nice, and had a larger bathroom and enough room for a seating area. 
The hotel staff is incredibly accommodating and helpful, except that a concierge forgot to make our birthday dinner reservations, but it wasn't an issue becauase I had called the restaraunt to confirm the reservations, and they were still able to get us in. 
It's located in more of a financial district than anything else, so it's a little quiet in the immediate neighborhood, but close to the Pike Place market, and shopping and the Seattle Art Museum, and the gorgeous library (worth looking at if you go to Seattle.)
Overall, it was good.I recently travelled to Seattle for business and stayed at the W Hotel. From SEA-TAC airport a cab will run you about $45 dollars depending on the time of day. I walked in to the Hotel and was greeted promptly by a very freindly staff. Check in went smooth and quickly, although I guess one of thier machines was broken so they had to call someone else to type my card number into the machine. I was given my room keys and was off to my room.
The room was very nice and the views were great. There are a lot of windows and they have the blinds open for you when you arrive. Closing them is a chore, but it is a pleasant one. On my desk there was also a small bottle of wine and a fruit and cheese plate with a letter welcoming me. I did not know whether or not this was complimentary or not so I did not endulge right away. The bathroom was quite large and the necessary bathroom amenities were there as well as some extra ones like face-wash that I notices was available. My search of the room continued as I found a small cupboard by the television contained some snacks such as snickers, almonds, M&Ms and other snacks. I looked around for the costs of these things but did not find any information. This becomes a reoccurring theme. Then I unlocked the mini bar to take a peek and again it was full of great items, but there was no information regarding a cost. Not wanting to pay an exorbitant amount for some M&Ms I simply closed the cupboard.
I had arrived late in the evening and was hungry, again not wanting to pay for snacks I proceeded to look for the hotel guide to see if there were any restaurants in the area. I looked around the TV...nothing. I looked on the Desk, in the desk, in all of the night-stands and flat surfaces...nothing. The only thing I found was an art book and a ""W"" shopping magazine (apparently this hotel also sells clothes for some reason). Fed up with searching and my hunger growing I went to the front desk to ask.
Again the front desk was very helpful when I asked about a sandwich place or a place to get something quick to eat, they pointed me to the subway. I got lost but it was not the fault of the hotel it was just my own curiosity. I found a Rock Bottom Brewery and then saw the subway on the way back.
The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The following morning I woke up at 3 am because I had flowin in form the East Coast. I waited until 7 and then remembered that I had heard the employee mention to the guest checking in in front of me something about breakfast. I was starving by this point so I called the front desk to cancel my wake-up call and asked about breakfast. They told me it was on the 2nd floor. I went down to breakfast and was greeted by a buffet of eggs and fruit and other meats. I though this was quite a good complimentary breakfast until the waiter dropped off the bill. It was only $22 bucks, but when you think it is complimentary, that is quite a shock. Maybe I would have known this if they had a hotel guide.
We used the facilities for a conference and aside from the construction, which I knew about before attending, the facilities were amazing. The staff was quick to react to any request, and the water glasses were always filled with delicious water. I cannot mention enough how great the staff was.
Check out was a breeze. My bill was under my door the morning I woke up and all I had to do was use the check-out feature on the TV and then leave my keys in the room. I did not get a chance to use the Acura experience by a fellow meeting attendee did and he had nothing but good things to say about it.
Aside from the hotel guide that I wish they had, everything about this hotel was great, and I wish I could see it when the renovations are complete. I saw pictures and am sure it will be amazing. I gave this hotel 4/5 but it would be more like 4.5/5. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay downtown.I have a real mixed view of this hotel. I have stayed here several times before and have found that the hotel staff seem well trained and are very enthisatic. I lkie the hotel design and always get good sleep with the great beds/linnens. On the other hand, I feel like they are very stingy with spg platinum upgrades. For example, if you book a corner room, they will tell you that they upgraded you by putting you in a corner room on a higher floor. When I checked at the spg website, there were plenty of ""better"" rooms showing available. The manager's explanation was that the website was in error. I have not made up my mind about this hotel, but i am trending towards a negative review.Great rooms, very clean, Nice decoration, great bathroom I was lucky to get a high floor room, the downtown Seattle view from my window was very nice !Ok location. Syrupy sweet clueless front desk staff. Generous size rooms. You should get a prize for finding the front door. The address is on 4th Avenue, but the entrance is actually on Seneca. Valet parking looks like you are pulling into the building not a parking structure. There is NO self parking. They will direct you to a garage on the corner, but if you are travelling on business or accuring hotel points this garage does not bill to the hotel. Very dark rooms, as in no lights, not as in dark enough to sleep late. Many better options in the area.Stayed at the W for the first time last weekend, because we had found an excellent web special. The lobby is currently under renovation (so we missed out on the awesome lounge), we were upgraded as a result. The room was very spacious for two people, had a good sized bathroom with lovely Bliss products. There's also a well-equipped fitness centre, and a car service (which we didn't use but will next time). Our room also had a very generous sofa/window seat with a great view over the harbour.$45 parking per day. NO in-room coffee or internet. Ordinary rooms & beds. Heavenly beds are better @ Westin. Great location, walking distance to Pike Place and downtown shopping.I stayed at the W Hotel last weekend and had a marvelous stay. It is simply one of the best locations to shops, restaurants, business district and the waterfront. The service is excellent, rooms are spotless and the W has the comfiest beds in the business. The staff treats you like family, and is the perfect blend between comfortable and stylish. I travel over 50,000 miles a year and stay all over the country, so I understand Hotels, and I love W Seattle.I stayed at the W for a recent conference in Seattle. The hotel is in an okay location -- fairly central but other hotels are closer to the attractions, shopping, etc. Everything was about a 3-5 block away -- not bad but again other places were closer. 
My biggest complaint is that the W ""vibe"" is getting a little tired and not fulfilling the brand promise. The idea of a hip, cool hotel with great service and amenities seems to be lacking now...the hotel is a little worn -- furnishings and common areas are showing their age and ""turning the lights down"" even more is no longer able to hide it. 
The service was atrocious. Long wait for everything. No ""whatever whenever"" staff on duty, no concierge, lines too long at front desk to ask them. The rooms are comfortable albeit again a tad worn and the beds and bathrooms are nice, clean and comfortable. The lack of a clear parking solution is not good for business travelers with cars. There are so many other nice hotels in Seattle, I would try one of them before returning here again.Second time staying at the W in Seattle. Highly recommend it as a great place to stay with easy access to shopping and great resturants.The W Hotel in Seattle is centrally located, downtown - within walking distance to most sights and numerous wonderful restaurants. The entire hotel is quite modern and simple in its decor - but not uncomfortably so. The staff is extremely helpful, room and maid service was efficient, and the views over the city are captivating. We are Starwood members, but I never got the impression, service for any others would be any different. We found the room to be very comfortable for our three day visit, with plenty of room for not only the two of us but all of our luggage and camera gear. The bathrooms here are very large and the bed was divinely comfortable and conducive to deep sleep. We'd stay here anytime we came through Seattle, for business or pleasure.I recently stayed at the W. It had been approximately 8 years since I stayed at this property. It is exactly the same - and this is good and bad. The common areas - bar, etc. still seem modern and hip with a very loungy feel. The rooms are a bit worn. I love the set up of the room - especially the large window seat - but it needs a bit of updating. The bed is very comfortable with lots of pillows. The bathroom is very spacious, but is showing wear and tear. The location is perfect and a pleasant walk to all the attractions in Seattle. I was disappointed that valet was not available during my stay. They do not have enough parking spaces to accommodate the guests. I thought the bartenders were attentive and professional. The restaurant is wonderful and convenient when you don't want to leave the property for a meal. Overall, it is a good, convenient place to stay when visiting downtown Seattle. But... it didn't leave me feeling like I would want to stay here every time I visit downtown. Some of the smaller boutique hotels (Hotel Monaco just across the street being one) are also great properties with wonderful amenities.We have never been disappointed when staying at the W Hotel in Seattle. Compared to other nearby hotels The W Hotel is centrally location to many great restaurants, the waterfront, shopping, and it also has superior rooms with views and comforts not matched elsewhere.
We don't rely on help from the front desk or concierge as there is typically a line nor do we rely on their having coffee in the lobby when we decide to leave the room mid-morning. We do our homework so we know where to grab coffee on our way to whatever we decide to do that day.
I recommend you stay more than one time to get a full appreciation for The W. I guarantee you will be a frequent guest from then on......I stayed here for three nights for business and also attended a conference in the hotel. As for the conference, the food was good and the water was very refreshing (they put a mint leaf, lime, and strawberry). As for the hotel itself, check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk friendly. Though, i called down once to ask a question and nobody answered which was a tad annoying. I was on the fifth floor and the room was very spacious as was the bathroom. Loved the Bliss products. Even though i was near the elevator, my room was quiet. The one thing that was frustrating was maintaining the heat at the correct level, half the time i was burning up even though i kept turning it down. The gym was nice, lots of machines and weights. I went in the evening when it wasn't crowded, though heard it was packed in the morning. I didn't eat at the restaurant, but had conference food which was very tasty. I did hang out at the bar, which was a nice atmosphere with the DJ and popular even with those staying at nearby hotels. Service was attentive from the bartenders as well. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and i would stay again. One thing it takes a while to get used to is the dim lighting, it is hard to find people you are looking for in the bar until your eyes adjust. I had the same problem in the room, never quite the right lighting. They charge nearly $15/day for internet which is a bit obnoxious. The location is easily walkable to some of the prime Seattle attractions, though since it is in the business district, things die way down at night and coffee shops aren't open on the weekends. Something to consider. Though, within a few blocks or short cab ride are lots of other choices for dining and entertainment.We stayed at the W Seattle this past weekend. The front desk staff was great and very welcoming. Our room was Wonderful and could not have asked for more. Clean, sleek, sexy....just like you would expect from W! I loved the huge bath towel. We had drinks before leaving for dinner on Saturday night. Great service, great appetizers and great martinis! We called a couple times during our stay for extra bath amenities and they were so promt in bring ""whatever"" up to our room. Great Job W.....I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Location is perfect too. Can walk to everything! We had brunch at the hotel on Sunday morning. Awesome.....we had an omlet which was very good and blueberry pancakes. The highlight was the dish I ordered. It had dungeness crab, potatoes and poached eggs. I could have eaten it all day it was so good. (per my request they even over cooked my eggs just like I enjoy them!) Stay at the W Seattle and make your time in Seattle extra special!When I spend 200+ dollars a night for a hotel room I expect to be treated well. The customer service in this hotel is lacking. And there is no coffee maker in the room. When I called the front desk at 1015 am I was told there was coffee in the lobby but only until 10, so no I could not have a cup of coffee. They said they could send up a coffee maker but they did not have any ground coffee. I stayed at the hotel 1000 a little less than a year ago and would highly recommend every to stay there instead. Better rooms and better/friendlier staff.Stayed here for 7 days in early September on business, stayed previously about 6 years ago so it was interesting to return and see if the W flag still flys proudly here. Had a wow room on 15th floor facing the sea (well sort of through some buildings) but it was a good south facing view. However room was looking tired, furniture was edgy, worn, aircon noisy. Generally though the W was pretty good, Fire & Earth restaurant still first class. The one thing though I must speak about is the truly awful, surly, attitude ridden bar staff. its not exactly the biggest bar in the world but I sat here with friends and it would have been easier to get arrested than get an attentive bar service.Stayed here this week (10/29). Have stayed many times here but like the W NYC, the rooms could use some updating. The lobby is very cozy, staff are relatively friendly and notice you when you walk through the lobby. The rooms have the nasty brown duvets that I cannot imagine get washed each and every time a guest leaves. The walls are paper thin and I heard a couple getting it on next door. They went out partying and I woke up at 3 am to hear their ridiculous radio thumping and I assume more getting it on. I called the front desk but nothing was done. I might return, but Seattle seems to be getting some cool boutique hotels that will give this place a run for its money unless they step up their game.This W has a great, club like atomsphere, good looking people. Tried to get a drink at bar, they didn't have wine glasses, bartender had to leave to get some. Took a while. Called to ""whenever, whereever"" at 6am, no answer. Called again a few min later, no answer. These are minor, but thought I should mention it. I was only there 1 night.I booked a room at the W hotel last minute on a weekend to attend a football game. I called the hotel directly and was able to get a decent discount. If you plan on using their valet know that it's pretty pricey($40) and that it's kind of confusing to find. The valet entrance was so small and packed with cars that they told me to park on the sidewalk. It makes it kind of difficult to unpack your car, and then haul your luggage up stairs to get to the lobby. The lobby is pretty small but contemporary and well appointed. Check-in was easy and they upgraded us to a nicer room. The spectacular room was well furnished with a nice view. Nice couch near window. Bathroom was nice but looked a little tired. Cracking tile, dirty grout, and a shower that didn't drain properly. Bath towels were horribly scratchy and old. Bath products were Bliss brand which are very nice. The room had a nice ipod dock, but it did not work. I later found out that you had to have the T.V. on in order for it to work. It would have been nice if they had some directions explaining that in the room. The bed was extremely comfortable. Climate control worked well, except it was run by a sensor so if you left the room when you came back it was hot and stuffy because the system shuts off. Also, no coffee maker which I found interesting especially in a city like Seattle. Overall, a comfortable room but definitely in need of a face lift. As far as the rest of the hotel, there is a bar that is in the lobby that had a D.J. at night time. It was a lot of fun, drinks were good, appetizers were okay. In conclusion, I would recommend the W. It is in a great location. The price is reasonable if you can get a discount. The bar is nice, and the public areas are trendy and cool. However the rooms need renovating. I would have been unhappy had I paid full price for a room. So wonderful, no, but with some help it could be.I checked in for 4 nights last weekend. We booked a Fabulous room but were upgraded to Cool Corner Suite. The hotel is in the main part of downtown Seattle, close to shopping, great places to eat and a short walk from Pike Place Market. This W is either the 3rd or 4th W hotel built, which was in 1998, so the rooms aren't as ""up to date"" as the new ones, but they're still great. The only thing that could use a little but of a make-over would be the bathrooms - still very clean and spacious, but not as ""cool"" as the new W's. The service (front desk, restaurant, bar, room service) was still awesome. Great place to stay in Seattle.We stayed here for a small conference. Everyone really enjoyed this hotel. The location is great and we got a good rate. The lobby is very small, but that made it fun because you saw everyone coming and going. The rooms were large. I liked the big desk and loved the super long window sofa. They also use Bliss products so we teased each other about smelling lemony fresh! I would stay here for work or leisure again. Pike's Place is about a 10 min walk away. Our favorite restaurant was Elliott's Oyster House, which was straight down the hill by the water. Warning if you go there the climb back is like hiking 10 flights of stairs if you take the direct route!I am not a fan of the W hotels. From the trendy atmosphere and style to the over technological gadgets in the rooms, I try to avoid the brand. If you read my other reviews, you know I’m stodgy, so no apologies. Unlike my experiences at sister properties in a number of other cities, the W Seattle was actually really nice. Yes, there was still the black lacquer motif and a strange bedside device for time and, I guess, some other purposes. Something was different though…
The first thing I noticed on entering the hotel is that the driving entrance goes to the lobby, but the “pedestrian” entrance requires you to cross through the bar to go up to check-in. It was late, so I anticipated the thumping beats and hip music. Somehow, they managed to, without walls or obvious blocks, to ensure that I did not have to yell or lean in to hear the desk clerk (Ashley?). She was perky and quick, and within a few moments I was off to the elevators. I later learned that they take a $150 hold as opposed to many other hotels’ $100 hold, but that’s not a dramatic amount, and it appears they credited it back to me without billing errors, so no worries… if the $50 makes a difference, you should probably not be staying at such a pricey hotel anyway, right? It is pricey.
The room was clean. Noticeably. I appreciated the sofa that ran the length of the window, and think that if I were planning to travel with a group or have a romantic evening, this setup would be perfect. Who wants to sit on your bed with no back support? Not stodgy folks like me! There was also a DVD player. I like that. It’s a bit incongruous since the W is not a family hotel… if you read reviews disliking this property, check the qualifiers… if they came with a family they don’t understand branding. If you DID come with kids though, what better way to keep them entertained without commercials than a DVD player? Not useful to people like me that like to get out and see the city when traveling, but still a clever idea. The bed was comfortable, and the location proved convenient for all of my activities. The Space Needle might be better accessed from a different property, but I still walked there without being too winded.
So far, this is the one W hotel that I’d be pleased to book again.Your first staff impression is the front desk in any hotel. Put unpolished inexperienced people behind registration and your brand is tarnished. Having stayed at Ws mostly in New York, I might be expecting more for service. The reception area was staff with 20 somethings who were obviously not trained in customer service. 
When I asked, ""Could you provide the name of a couple unique Seattle restaurants in the area?"", I received a list of chain restaurants including The Capital Grille and Chipolte. I walked over to the Fairmont hotel (which the front desk never heard of) and asked them. They gave me a nice list of restaurants and offerred to make the reservation for me even though they knew I was staying at the W.
W Hotels are known for placing more value on their lobby space than their rooms, so I was surprised this lobby was ho hum and the rooms standard W fare.
The gym was standard, bit cramped and not well ventilated. There was a morning line for the cardio machines.I recently stayed at the W as I was attending a conference at the hotel during the last week of September. I had high expectations as I understood that the W hotels have a good reputation for being contemporary, high service hotels.
The hotel is dark, rooms are OK....not too special. I was disappointed overall with the quality of furnishings and surroundings. The sink in the bathroom wouldn't drain and had to call to have the sink repaired as soon as I checked in. The water pressure at the hotel was horrible, it took about 30 minutes to run 2 inches of water in the tub. I heard similar complaints from other guests.
The hotel is in a great downtown location but I don't think it's worth the high price.This is a high end property with a minimalist design. The front desk and other staff were all efficient, professional and very helpful without any attitude. The elevator required your room key to go to your floor and since I was with my daughter I appreciated this security feature. The room was very basic without allot of storage space. They had an outlet strip and multiple outlets, I Pod. docking station and a plasma TV. I could not hear any city noise but we were on the fifth floor. The toilet was very short and the sink was small almost like a child's bathroom. The shower was great with a larger shower head but the hardware was difficult to use and seemed cheap.The toiletries had a nice clean scent. The beds were comfortable with feather beds and the linens were wonderful. This whole property was very clean and had a calming vibe to it.The front of the hotel was quite ugly but the valet parking was at the side and that entrance looked better.The location was fabulous and close to everything downtown.I had high expectations that this property was going to be top-tier, but was disappointed that it was no different than any other full-service hotel. I had a good deal because otherwise this was totally out of my price range, but I can't figure out why. I had a co-worker as me when I returned if the W Seattle was the best hotel that I have ever stayed at and I replied that no it wasn't even close. I guess I was disappointed that the W did not live up to its excellent reputation.This is one of the better hotels I've stayed out in Seattle. It provides everything you've come to expect from a W Hotel - good mattresses, nice linens, well appointed bathroom, bustling lobby bar, high level of service.
It's in a good location - central and downtown.
Avoid doing the valet parking if you can - it's $40.This is an interesting property. Great location if you have biz downtown, not quite as good for tourism, but not too bad if you are going to Pike Place, Ivars, museum, or other downtown locations. It is quite obviously an older Westin property that was converted to a W at the start of the W hotel project. It looks about half and half Westin and W. Limited food and beverage, but a creative bar. Almost nothing to do at the hotel itself, surprisingly not even a pool. The redeeming value is a really great and polite staff. They are young, but not afraid to make decisions to help out guests. I was very impressed with their level of service.Good location , fast check in although we were simply handed our room key I think it would have been nice if the desk clerk could have said "" you are in room so and so floor etc 
The cd player didn't work 
lamp next to the bed switch was loose 
most annoying was the housekeeper knocking on the door at 9am we told her we were checking out at noon 
then at 11.15 she knocked again same person that was annoying !After reading some of the earlier reviews of this hotel, we were a bit concerned about whether or not we would like it. We recently spent five nights there and were extremely pleased. The staff is very attentive and knowledgeable, the housekeeping is impeccable, the rooms are well appointed and the location is superb. We have stayed at several other Seattle hotels but this will become our hotel of choice in the future.We stayed here for three nights in August 2011. Our room was clean, spacious and well furnished with a comfortable bed. The hotel is within walking distance to the Pike Street Market, the waterfront and public transport. Staff were attentive at check in and the hotel was more than willing to hold my bag for a couple of hour whilst I killed some time after check out. The lobby area was a nice place to sit and whilst we did not use this facility, the gym did look to have a good selection of fitness equipment.
The only complaint I had was the wireless internet. The speed and connection was fine, however it was disappointing that you could only purchase access for one device per session. Connecting a second device will disconnect the other. I have no problem paying for wireless internet, however it would have been nice if we could connect more than one device at a time. During our trip, we stayed in less exclusive hotels that allowed multiple connections on the one access code.My stay began Sunday and ended this morning. I was in corner room 2012. I found the check in staff to be quite pleasant, and they quickly helped locate the valet so that I could park my car; I was surprised that no one was at the valet station for several minutes after I arrived, but I did arrive late on Sunday so it wasn't a big deal. I was offered the customary points bonus or wine (I am a platinum level guest) and told about the gym (pretty nice compared to many other hotels). It was an easy checkin and a welcome experience after my trip.
The room was very nice, and during my stay the only complaint I have is that an awful lot of street and HVAC noise made it into the room. So much that I had a hard time sleeping on Wednesday night when the wind blew just right and made some noise at the window. I'm not sure what the solution is for this. The tv remote works flawlessly, and it was neat that there was a DVD player in the room - although I did not use it. I was very comfortable overall.
There was only one thing that marred my experience: the last interaction with the front desk this morning. I noticed that I was charged $45.14 for parking vs. The advertised $37, so I wanted to find out why. I asked the young man and young lady at the desk this morning about the discrepancy. I was told that the city tax had been included in the total, and that it was on the sign as $37 + tax. I told them I felt it was a bit like a bait and switch, but that I understood and felt that perhaps it would be helpful to have the tax as a seperate line item on the reciept - to avoid this issue in the future. There was some back and forth conversation about the tax, and I reiterated that I felt it should be a seperate line item, like other Starwood hotels in the area. In response, the young man smirked at me and told me that all the hotels in the area do it this way (they don't), and that it was 'clearly on the sign'. 
I am sorry, but at midnight on a rainy Sunday night it isn't clear, and I certainly don't appreciate being laughed at. As a former employee of the Westin Kierland I know the level of service expected by Starwood employees. This fell FAR below expectations. I felt stupid and insulted and like I told you as I walked out the door: I'll just stay at the Sheraton next time: the only issue there is that they're often full.
This can be fixed, which is why I am posting this review. Starwood hotels have been and will continue to be my first choice when travelling. I would recommend this hotel, but only as second choice to the Sheraton for business travelers.We stayed at the W in Seattle last week for a conference. This is a business-oriented hotel situated within the downtown financial district, within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, numerous restaurants, and shopping. What impressed us most during our stay at the W were the staff. Often times, staff attitudes to guests can make or break the experience but every staff member with who we interacted was incredibly professional, efficient, friendly, and welcoming (other hotels could learn a thing or two from the W Seattle about guest relations)!
We had opted to upgrade to a Spectacular Room (room category) on the 20th floor and were happy to have done so, given the traffic sounds from below. Having researched this property earlier, I was already aware of the advertised room rates but as this was our conference venue we were fortunate enough to obtain a corporate rate. While the room was spacious and the bed was comfortable, the accommodations overall were still slightly underwhelming (definitely not ""Spectacular""). The room easily showed signs of wear and tear-----scuffed walls, worn furniture and upholstery----that truly should have been corrected to help justify the pricey room rates and to stay within standards one would expect of the W Hotel brand. Other practical suggestions on areas to improve are:
• Improve the lighting in the room, particularly the bathroom----there’s nothing worse than trying to apply makeup using lighting that gives everyone and everything a jaundiced cast.
• Install a towel hook on the back of the bathroom door----the current hook is impractically placed on the VERY narrow strip of wall between the bathroom door and the start of the shower tiles, so hanging anything on it will prevent the door from closing unless the object is first moved.
• Provide a recycling bin to help reduce waste.
• Provide a plastic bag/liner for the ice bucket----this is much more hygienic, given that one simply cannot be certain of how well the bucket is washed out between guests.
The lounge/bar was quite busy. Also be warned that only valet parking is available at this hotel, at the cost of $45.00 per day.
I would not hesitate to return to this hotel (albeit at a corporate rate) and will keep my fingers crossed that W hotel management will act on some of the suggestions that I and other reviewers have made.I stayed there as I was part of a conference. I visit Seattle a lot for pleasure and had always wanted to stay at the W but could not afford it. Well first off we had to circle the block twice. I was sure it was there but the lack of lighting on the building made it impossible at night to see the sign. The interior is dark. The room was ok, it was large and comfy but I was indifferent to the space. My room (711) had a view of the parking lot that everyone could look into, fine turn the venetian blinds well no matter what I tried the light still seeped in, this did not bother me but I know it would bother many. There was a card on the night table that said because of the view I get free internet, I confirmed this but it was still on my bill, it was removed. (Why does any hotel charge for internet these days?). There was good free coffee in the lobby in the morning and a nice refreshing drink in the afternoon (hint to tourists not staying there but walking by). As for environmentally friendly??? None not even a note requesting you to reuse your towel. I turned off all my lights but when I came back all were on, including the bathroom, this was part of the turn down service. I guess they are making up for the darkness everywhere else. I am not sure of the W brand elsewhere but it is definitely overpriced in Seattle. I would not stay there again there are way better hotels for the same price or less in the vicinity.The hotel room is so very dark - it is the hotel's style but we found it depressing. There was plenty of wardrobe and drawer space for clothes.
The bar is located in space normally a corridor, quite off-putting. The bar furniture is very tired, I wouldn't want to entertain there.
The restaurant although highly rated and award winning was very quiet, we didn't try it as it was expensive and there is so much choice nearby at more affordable rates; including a Starbucks across the road for breakfast.
The hotel staff were helpful and polite at all times.
I feel sure for there are better choices in Downtown Seattle.Stayed at the W in Seattle last weekend. The location is very good but I find the hotel to be overrated. The parking is expensive, $45.00 / night with taxes. The bathroom has no shelf space, only the top of the counter around the sink, the television does not show what programs are playing only the channel listing, the room is listed to be large yet 1/4 of the size is the front hallway which is wasted space, the lobby is very dark, there is no WIFI in the rooms, the feather pillows are awful, requested foam and they were slightly better. None of these issues are serious, but I expected better.This was my first time in Seattle and I picked the W because I can usually count on the brand name. W Seattle was no exception. The rooms were nice, easy check-in (although the lobby is incredibly small - fine if there's only 2 people checking in but more than that and you better not have any issue with your personal space being compromised), great service, friendly bartender, everything that you would expect from the W. It's in a good, central location and I would definitely stay there again.The staff is helpful, the hotel well maintained. Nice size rooms. In the heart of downtown, easy walking distance to many points. Walked to Safeco Park, Pike's Market and much more.I just spent a night with a bunch of girls at the W Seattle this past weekend. It was a great spot to convene and rest our heads after shopping and eating out. And because of its central location in DT Seattle, you can walk to everything!
I was mostly impressed with the hotel's service, as the facilities were on par with other Starwood properties. The front desk staff were helpful and happy, and almost every other staff member I came across had a smile on their face.
What I Liked
- the lounge area below the lobby
- free wifi in the lounge
- the Acura car service that would take you around the city
- the lobby's coffee by morn, and infused water by day
- the mattresses and sheets were ultra comfortable
- the rooms are a good size, and include a long and comfy banquette beside the window
What To Know
- the Acrua car service only runs until 6pm on weekends
- if the valet parking is busy, you have to line up on the street to get in as the loading area is tight
- there's a beautiful Parisian bakery across the street called Belle Epicurean {in the base of the Fairmont}
- the valet parking is $45 with taxes which is on the high-end of what city hotels {not including NYC} charge for parking.
- pets are allowed.I have stayed at the W in Seattle several times over the past several years. The rooms are great, the beds ""heavenly"" and the bathrooms are well stocked, clean and well lit. The problem with the hotel is the lobby. The reception desk is in a very tight area, if there are more than 10 people checking in or waiting for some help at the desk the area becomes very crowded and unpleasant. Down a steep set of stairs is a bar/lounge/restaurant area which is also awkward.a bit dark inside the halls but a very good overall experience... good location, but hard to find at night. Staff is great. Breakfast is excellent!We stayed here for one night post-cruise. It's pretty much your typical W with candles in the lobby, dark halls and a bustling bar scene. Interestingly, there also seemed to be a lot of families with members ranging from 5 to 70. I'm noting this because a lot of times the W crowd seems more ""adult"" and in town for business or pleasure. The rooms were comfortable and large with great views and comfy window seats, bathrooms were very large and I loved the Bliss bath products. Would have liked to stay longer and will probably book another stay next time we're in Seattle if I can get past the fact there's no coffee pot. Pet peeve is hotel rooms with no coffee pots, but that's becoming more the norm (sadly) and The W is following that trend. That being said, I didn't ask for one and it's possible they might have provided one upon request. Overall, it was a very nice hotel.I have always wanted to stay at a W Hotel and we got the opportunity to when we booked with Priceline for one night after our cruise. I was disappointed by several factors: hotel is very dark (hallways). Condition of the room was really beat up inlcluding banged up furniture and dirty dust ruffle. Lobby is very small. Location is very good for walking to anything in downtown Seattle. If you can get it for cheap on Priceline, then go for it, but wouldn't pay full price for this one.It was a pleasant Hotel. It was very busy upon arrival after getting off the cruise ship. They did store our bags and let us sit in the lobby which was very nice by the way. Evenutally we left to go to the Space Needle. Took the mono rail, which was fun. We had reservations but they couldn't find it. The concierge from the Westin was suppose to have made them. The resturaunt is nice but very pricey. The view was great again very pricey. You could get away with sharing a dish. We loved Pike's place. Our kids are 15 and 13 and they really lliked it to... Ulli's saugages are excellent. I butcher who was trained in Mannheim Germany. La Panier was a great cafe, great baked goods and sandwiches to go (like for the airplane ride). The W was okay. It has great Bliss products. We asked for a scale to weigh our luggage and they couldn't for the life of them accomodate that. Oh well, there are worse things in life. All in all it was a nice place to stay. Hotel Monacoo across the street accomodates pets.We celebrated our anniversary at the W and loved the hotel. While it is more subdued than many W Hotels we have been to before with less of a party scene or posh bar, it had the superb service that all W Hotels have and the location was perfect for us.
The staff delivered complimentary champagne to our room without us asking to celebrate our anniversary and then happily suggested restaurants in the area. We had done our homework and already had a good idea of where we wanted to eat, but we were glad to see they had similar suggestions-- made us think they really knew what they were talking about!
Since we were there for July 4th weekend they were very helpful in giving us off the cuff suggestions on where to watch fireworks and not have to be in huge crowds.
The location is about 3 blocks from Seattle Market, so we walked almost everywhere during the day...WEAR FLATS!!!! (made that mistake day 1 and didn't forget it! )
The concierge made sure to have transportation lined up within 10 minutes when we needed a car.
Rooms were updated and comfortable... look out for special deals- we got an EXCELLENT rate on kayak and were very pleased.When I made reservations at the W it was because of a very good rate I found on line - however, I hadn't had personal knowledge of the ""W"" hotels. Almost everyone I told I had made reservations was impressed and said how ""in"" the W hotels are. We had a wonderful view and great bedding, but I was not impressed with the hotel itself. Maybe I'm not young and ""in"" enough myself. I was expecting special and felt like it was at most typical of a hotel room. No in room coffee or amenities I would have anticipated in a place that seemed to get so much attention. The staff was excellent. We had a nice time. I just don't get the hype.W hotels can sometimes be out of the way. We found the location for this hotel to be great. It had a few restaurants around it but was a short cab ride to the theater and a 10 min walk to Pike Market. The rooms were very nice and very spacious. I booked the weekend using free weekend nights I had earned. Free water in the gym, free Starbucks coffee in the am, and the Acura service are always a plus when staying at the W. I'd def stay here again if I was to travel back to Seattle.W is in the heart of downtown Seattle. From the time you pull up in your car staff are helpful and attentive to your every need for checking in and beyond. The original art grouping behind the front desk is an indicator of what to expect. Rooms have great views, sculpted, deep pile carpets, dark cherry furniture, small monochrome pictures in oversize frames,beveled glass mirrors, bathrobes for him and her, a superbly comfortable king size bed with delicious pillows, and intriguing attention to detail throughout. There is subtle lighting in the hallways and elevator carpets mysteriously change from ""Good Afternoon"" to ""Good Evening"" to ""Good Morning"" as the time of day dictates. However, you will need deep pockets to stay here. Enjoy bacon and eggs in your room for a mere $23, and don't forget to order coffee as there is none supplied in the room. Pick up a cup in the lobby. W snacks in the room include chips, pretzels, nuts, mints, an ""intimacy kit"" ( use your imagination here), first aid kit, a corkscrew for the $48 bottle of W wine, and drinks of all kinds from soda to Champagne to enjoy with the Symmetry cd. And don't forget to feed the dog (pets are welcome). Beef and rice dinner for Poochie is only $25. The Bliss bath products will leave you smelling fresh and lemony for a late night date with the DJ and his booming sound machine in the lobby. Outside the door, taxis are always available to take you to Safeco Field for the Mariners game. Or you can walk there in a short half hour. Superb restaurants and wine bars are close by to the W. The hotel seems to appeal to a youthful but serious business clientele. Can't wait to come back and stay here again.This is one of the originalW hotels. Situated in the right part of town, very close to top restaurants, shopping and the wharf. The hotel is showing it's age and scheduled for renovations this November.I won a free night at the W Hotel and was unsure if I wanted to stay a second night there after reading the reviews of it being a dark and dingy hotel. I was upset when I arrived and realized that I should have booked my second night here instead of at another hotel since the W was really quite amazing! 
From the moment we stepped in, I was impressed by the ambiance and the great service. We arrived quite early, and while they didn't have a room available quite yet, they kept our bags for us while we got lunch and got one ready quite quickly. The room was clean, comfortable and modern. And the view was to-die-for! 
Yes, the hallways are dark, but that's the vibe of the hotel... And really, who wants to walk into a hallway that is blaring florescent lights?! 
Honestly, I have no complaints about the hotel, and would stay here again in a heart beat!I have been here twice, and each time, I have had a fabulous stay. Overall, it's not a super huge hotel, but it is very nice. The hotel is centrally located downtown. The rooms are a reasonable size, and they are extremely clean. They have electronic safes. The rooms are quiet. The bathrooms are very nice, not super-luxurious, but nice. There is nowhere to park around the hotel, and there is a Starbucks across the street. overall, it's a very good place. The gym is very small, but good enough for cardio.Nice updated downtown lobby and bar; neat part of seattle. 
No black out curtains in rooms. Great views from majority of rooms. Beds were not as comfortable as you would expect compared to the price. Staff very friendly. Overall, not the bang for the buck, in our opinion. No spa services available.I've stayed at the W two years in a row now for the Seattle Rock and Roll Marathon weekend. The location is great. This year I took the light rail from the airport and it was a breeze to get to. The staff are very good, very helpful. We had numerous changes with our 3 reserved rooms and they were accomodating with all of them. The dark lighting is too much in the hallways, definitely, but the rooms are very nice. The beds and pillows are the best. I never want to get out of bed! The Bliss products are always amazing and I love that they are never stingy with them and will always replenish! :) I never have to worry about parking, but I know that the cost in downtown Seattle is awful.Arrival went smoothly, public areas are stylish and comfortable, gym is nice sized and functional, rooms have great windows and comfortable beds. Rooms could use a clean coat of paint to freshen up the place. Bar was hopping at night, but restaurant deserted. I'd travel there again, but might choose the four seasons to get an outstanding view and convenient access to Pike Place market.Stayed at this hotel while on business and it was excellent. Great beds, great bathroom, nice service. Terrific Bliss products!! Lots of positives. and definitely much better than many other hotels especially the standard Mariotts, etc. The ""cool vibe"" and low lighting is kind of overdone, but who cares? It's kind of fun! Only two items to be aware of -- no free wifi and expensive parking (which is to be expected in a downtown hotel). Also, compared to other hotel affinity groups, Starwood Preferred Guests (SPG) really offers nothing -- not even a free bottle of water. So while I'd definitely stay here again and certainly would stay at other ""W"" hotels, SPG really needs to do more to attract the business traveler.nice clean room, helpful staff, great location.....only down side was $45 to park overnight.....ouch!The W Seattle is like any other W - funky, cool music playing, hot staff, well appointed rooms. The location of this particular W isn't bad either - about a 15-minute walk to the market/downtown, but 2 minutes to Purpl, an amazing restaurant and wine bar. Starbucks is across the street, which is not surprising and very convenient.
As an SPG platinum member, I was upgraded to a corner room (I forget the room type, the W uses annoying adjectives to describe room levels - I think this was a ""wonderful"" room). OK view, but great layout and very clean. Gym is small but gets the job done.
I took a star off because of the bar staff. I'm not sure if this particular server was having a bad day, but I asked for a tea as my stomach was upset, and he looked at me as if he couldn't believe I had the audacity to ask for tea at a bar. Also, upon check out, I got some attitude from one of the front desk staff because I asked for my folio to be both emailed and printed out. Minor points but had to be noted.My wife and I stayed here after seeing Les Miserables at nearby 5th Ave theater. The proximity to the theater and its reputation as a nice hotel are the main reasons I chose to stay here. Everyone was friendly and helpful and our room was tidy and clean. I would stay here again as long as I was not parking a car. I was charged $45 for overnight parking even though the rate displayed at the valet and listed on my reservation confirmation from Priceline was $37. Not a huge difference, but it did contribute to my final bill of $298 for a one night stay (Priceline rate was initially $219). 
A couple of small pet peeves of mine that may or may not matter to other travelers: The shower head was too short. I am only 6ft tall and I had to bend down to get my head wet. The towels were pretty well worn and rough and no better quality than a Holiday Inn Express I recently stayed at.
Kudos for a very comfortable bed with nice linens and a nicely stocked minibar.Overview: Just a regular hotel at this price point. I did not find this W hotel very special. As a supposed hip hotel targeted to younger guests I still do not understand why they do not offer free WiFi in the rooms. $14.95/day is kind of ridiculous. Rooms are nice but obviously a bit worn with some worn-out furniture, acceptably clean but not 4-star clean, and rusted/chipped/cracked fixtures in the bathroom. Not terrible but not 4-star. 
My visit:
Arrived by Amtrak from Portland and walked the approximately 1 mile from King Street Station (not a bad walk but it is uphill). 
Check in was quick and staff very pleasant. I am a SPG Gold member but did not receive an upgraded room. They did offer one free ""small"" (and it is small, like 300mL) bottle of Fiji water free per day from the minibar. Pretty ridiculous benefit but whatever...
Room is adequate size. Room was clean but not exactly 4-star clean. Some dust on the TV and night stand. Rust and peeling chrome in the bathroom. King bed and linens were very comfortable. Nice seating area by the window. I did not have much of a view in a ""Wonderful"" room. Some of the ""Spectacular"" rooms I saw did have view of the Space Needle which was nice. Air conditioning worked adequately but in the summer I tend to like to keep my room cold and it never really got cold. Not too hot, just not cold. 
Bathroom was large with nice hot shower but measly water pressure. Again, not four-star here. Typical W amenities of a variety of high quality Bliss products. Strangely there were 3 bath towels but each was a different material. (I don't know if this is like the ""choose your own pillow"" thing that W and other hotels have going on nowadays but I thought it was odd). Two terry robes are available but again these have seen better days. 
There is a small desk area. There is a flat screen TV (on the smaller side of things...maybe 35"") with the typical obnoxious hotel slow channel-changing remote. HBO is free. There is a DVD player. The front desk has about 35 old DVDs to checkout (and I do mean old...the newest movie on the list is probably from maybe 2000, if that). But there is an IGA supermarket nearby with a RedBox if staying in and watching a movie is your thing.
No in-room coffee (something I wish W would start offering). They do have decent coffee in the lobby. No newspaper delivery to the room but there were a couple of newspapers by the elevator...if you weren't quick enough though, they would all be gone. The ice machine on my floor was broken. I'm sure had I called the desk they would have brought ice. But, maybe when the ice machine on a floor is broken, they should just keep the ice buckets full in the rooms on that floor. This is what I expect from four star hotel which this W is obviously not. 
I did not spend much time in the evening at the hotel itself so I can't comment on nightlife there but it seemed even returning late in the evening there was still quite a crowd in the lobby/bar.
I did get the complimentary 4:00pm checkout as a SPG Gold without a problem. Again staff was pleasant and efficient at checkout.
Hotel is in a good location. There are a lot of restaurants and bars nearby. It's is easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, the modern glass & steel public library, and Bank of America/Columbia Center Tower (the tallest building in Seattle with an observation deck). If you head a bit far south it does get a bit sketchy at night so just be aware...overall Seattle is relatively safe. It's about 1-1/2 mile walk to SafeCo field and Qwest (now named something even dumber) field or a quick bus ride if you are going to an event. Public transportation in Seattle is excellent so if you are wondering if you should rent a car or not for a short visit I would not bother...as long as you are staying in the Seattle area. You could always rent a car for one day if you wanted to make a day trip to sites farther afield and there are plenty of rental car places around the hotel area. 
I would not stay at the W Seattle again. Nothing particularly bad about the hotel but I think you could do better at this price point. They need to fix the bathrooms and clean the rooms a bit better. W should offer free internet. Although the other big chains at this price point don't, all the independent boutique hotels do; and these boutique hotels are really the main competition for W hotels, in my opinion.Great place to stay. I'm partial to this collection of hotels. This is an older property, but it has been well maintained. The staff is friendly, helpful and very accommodating. You can't beat the location if your traveling for pleasure - right downtown and very near the waterfront. Beware -parking is expensive!Can someone please turn on some freaking lights in this place, feels more like a night club than a hotel. They actually even had a dj mixing it up in the lobby, give me a break! 
No free Internet access, a 1992 Sony cordless phone--I believe my last stay at a holiday inn had nicer amenities.W hotels never fail to impress. Large, comfortable room with refrigerator and safe. A really comfortable bed. Nice, comfortable sofa window seat. The bathroom is outstanding and the products are minty fresh.
It has a hip, trendy vibe, and a comfortable lobby where you can relax, mix, mingle, meet friends, anything you want to do. The staff is attractive, attentive, and very nice.The W is known for its exceptional style and service. Other than some troubles with the valet service, the Seattle W does not disappoint. 
The room was beautifully appointed - comfortable and sleek furnishings with the well known *heavenly bed* standard. The bathroom wasn't quite as exciting as we expected, but the ample assortment of towels and toiletries was great.
W is perfectly located for many of the downtown attractions and shopping areas. If you need a short ride, please take advantage of the Acura free ride service while it lasts. The concierge and Acura reps were friendly and fun.
The only drawback was the parking situation - I knew in advance it could be spendy to have a car - but $37 plus tips to the valet per day was above my guess. The cost was especially disappointing, when the valet was often too busy to take the car into the garage. A few times they left it sitting in the street while jockeying everything around...not my preferred comfort level on a busy street. Valet staff was incredible and quite courteous, just extremely overworked with a poor setup for a garage.
I'd stay at the Seattle W again in a heartbeat, but leave the car somewhere else.My boyfriend and I stayed at the W in Seattle on the weekend of August 5, 2011. We stayed in a room with two double beds as they were out of king beds. The W provides amenities from the Bliss brand, which is great. For a double, the room is on the small side. However, they have an upgraded in-room stereo with an iPod charger/player and the decor was well above average. These extras made up for the smaller size. There is a happening bar downstairs, but it is much smaller than I imagined. We went down about 10pm and it was so busy that we ended up walking down the road to the Purple Cafe. All in all, the W is great and I'd recommend it.A quick trip to Seattle brought me to W Seattle. The first impression was after a very delayed flight. I ended up in the hotel lobby super late and was greeted by the sounds of karaoke. Kind of fun but luckily something I couldn't hear in my room. The front desk workers (and all the staff I encountered) were very friendly and helpful.
The hallways were a little dark, but the room itself was great. The beds were VERY comfortable and the room had a great window seat. I could have spent all day curled up on the window seat. I also appreciated the Bliss Spa toiletries provided in the bathroom.
The location of the W Hotel can't be beat. The hotel is only a few blocks away from Pike Market and close to plenty of shopping and food. Next door to W Hotel, make sure to stop at the Belle Epicurean for early morning pastries. You won't regret it.
The only downside was the fact that you had to pay for WiFi services. It seems unnecessary and disappointing these days to have to pay for WiFi at a hotel. Other than the WiFi issue, I completely enjoyed my stay at the W Hotel.A couple hundred dollars a night and no Internet. Rooms were so-so. Mini blinds on the windows not what I expected for a W hotel. Customer service was very bad the first two days and better towards the end. Bought a bottle of champagne from hotel and then told we could not enjoy in downstairs 
Do not recommend the restaurant/bar downstairs. Foot was below average and we paid $41.00 for two drinks.My wife and I stayed here the night before our cruise. The hotel was very nice and was in a great location. It's minutes walking distance from Pike's Market and other great Seattle attractions. It's also conveniently located only a block from the transit system. The gym was really nice. They also offer complimentary transportation to the pier for anyone leaving on a cruise.A bit older as far as W's go, but still quite nice. If you are an SPG member, this is the place you want to go. Westin, a few blocks away is horrible and Sheraton is ok, but if you are using points, Sheraton and W are both 10000 points each. W is easily nicer than Sheraton. The vibe is really nice and the elevators are ridiculously fast...why can't all hotels have elevators as fast as this one?Loved the decor, amenities, and sleek bar/lounge on the first floor. The sexy fries are to-die-for. The rooms are spacious. We got a complimentary upgrade, so we had a giant sofa in the room that can easily sleep another person. It was nice to be able to hangout in your own hotel bar/lounge after a long day of walking!The attentive reception personnel were welcoming and had me in a room although I arrived around 1:00. 
I missed having no tea maker or microwave - but in the land of coffee there is something available within a block in either direction.
The free transportation around downtown is offered mid-day and wasn't available to get to Pier 66 for a conference that started at 8:00 am on a Saturday.
The room was huge, clean, comfortable, view was to the north over the Olympic Hotel. Easy to sleep. Despite being downtown - quiet.Hotel was alright. I am not sure if it was because I used points, but had no maid serice, we were only a couple of nights so it wasn't a big deal, but curious none the less. The hotel is a little off the beaten track but still close to walk to lots of things.
I really enjoyed Seattle and how easy it was to get around. Found most things reasonably priced, meals, transportation, etc. Would definitely plan a trip back. I would probably try the Westin or the Sheraton next time, just a little closer to things and appeared to hae more ammenities.OK, let me admit it at the start - I like W Hotels. If there is a W in the city I am visiting I will stay in it. BUT, they do vary across the world with the newer ones a lot better than the older ones. This W is one of the originals and it is beginning to show its age in the rooms. It is not as luxurious or as well equipped and the fittings are a bit tired/worn. The restaurant was up to scratch, great breakfast with unlimited strong coffee. Room service was very quick the few times I used it.
As ever it is the staff (not the rooms) that make a hotel and they were top notch. What I like about them is that you can sit at the bar on your own and they know just how intrusive to be. Like most W bars this one was used by non-residents so there is always a great vibe and someone to chat to. Excellent cocktails and draft beers at the usual expensive Seattle prices. The DJ set is definitely an afterthought, the poor guy has a temporary table and speakers, rather than a proper booth. A bit like a DJ at a UK wedding..... 
Special note: I stayed on 19th floor and never waited more than 10 seconds for a lift - they must have some good software controlling them!We stayed at the W Seattle before our cruise to Alaska. We are SPG gold members and this was one of several options we had to redeem points for a pre-cruise stay. The reception area is very nice with a large bowl of apples available for snacks. There is usually spa water or coffee available too. The room was nice. We had two queen beds and a couch built into the window. The heavenly bed that each room comes with always ensures me that I will be sleeping well. The bathroom was decent sized too. 
Accessibility was the main plus for this hotel. Getting to the hotel was super easy. We like taking public transportation that is easy to use and Seattle is a great city for using buses and trains. We took the light rail from the airport to the hotel as we were not in any hurry. It was so cheap, about $3 per person and we got off one block from the hotel. Our main problem is that we travel very heavy and had to haul 250 pounds of luggage up the hill one block to the hotel. Even that wasn't too bad. In comparison, we could have taken a taxi for about $50. The hotel offered the Acura test drive experience where you could get a free ride around town within 5 miles of the hotel. We arranged for a ride to the cruise ship the next day which saved about $15 in taxi fares. All our saved transportation fees covered our extra baggage fees for the airline! 
 Location was good although there seemed to be a Westin closer to the big mall in the center of town that had the monorail to the Space Needle. However, the W was located in an area where you could get on any public bus and travel. We enjoyed a nice walk both mornings of our stay to the first Starbucks at Pike Place to get coffee although there was another Starbucks just across the street from the hotel (and practically every corner in between). 
 A big plus was that after the cruise, the W held our luggage for us until we were ready to travel to the airport. We took a taxi back from the cruise ship, checked in our luggage, and walked around town. When we were ready to go to the airport we enjoyed a one block walk down to the light rail and had an easy ride to the airport.
Our trip to Seattle was very pleasant and the W suited our needs perfectly!This was my first stay in a W, but I understand most of them are pretty dark. I only stayed one night so I cna't say much about it.
The fitness center was great.
The business center was lacking, but it got the job done.
There is no parking, so you'll have to shell out about $20 for overnight parking nearby.
The city views are nice.Stayed in the W as my usual choice, the Westin, was full. Enjoyed the experience - rooms are stylish, though a lot smaller than the Westin, staff friendly and helpful, toiletries provided in bathroom were by Bliss, which I love, and both the room service and restaurant/breakfast food was excellent. On the downside, this is a really ""cool""hotel so if you're put off by that, avoid. The lobby is dark with loud, atmospheric music so forget about having any business meetings or working there! Quality and variety of food was better than the Westin, and the location is good, in a nice part of town, walkable to shopping and amenities. Not as high rise as the Westin, so views not as good, but I can live with that. Great place. I'd go back on a pleasure trip, rather than business, but it's equally good as a business hotel.I've stayed in this hotel 15 nights over the last 5 weeks, and I was very happy. Great location to many walking destinations, the valet is quick, the lounge is nice, the staff is friendly, and the rooms are large and spacious with a couch.We loved our stay at the W Seattle. It's a great location for the waterfront, shopping and the baseball stadium. The rooms were lovely, well appointed with great amenities. The front lobby atmosphere is funky and inviting, with a fireplace and couches that provide a great place to read or meet friends. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.We rode the Amtrak from Vancouver, BC to Seattle and walked from the station to the hotel with no problems. It was quite a ways to walk and if you are not in pretty good shape you may want to bus or cab it and would not recommend walking it at dark. We got to hotel before noon and were pleasantly surprised our room was ready.  We thought the room was really nice and in a great location. I found the WiFi did not work very well in the lobby but as soon as I went out the front door I was able to connect to Starbucks WiFi. Everyone seemed very nice and the free coffee in lobby in the morning was actually very good...SEATTLE DOES LIKE THEIR COFFEE.We came to W Seatle after a West Coast Road Trip with our family and it was a wonderful ending to a trip that was a priceless experience!!!Each year I stay at the W Seattle at least once. In 10 years of traveling to Seattle, the last 3 have been with the W every time. The staff continues to be amazing, the accommodations are perfect, and the location is super convenient. I brought my wife this time and she was also very pleased...and my wife finds problems with every hotel so her positive experience is priceless.We stayed at the W Seattle for four nights and had plenty of time to study this interesting hotel. First of all, the staff at the reception were not only unfriendly, but even snobbish. Same applies to the concierge that showed a similar level of (in)competence as the reception guys and seemed to be more interesting in surfing a bit on the internet than making a reservation at a restaurant... The hotel is definitely overpriced for what you get. I'm staying at Starwood hotels pretty often and in general appreciate the service and comfort you get. W Seattle was definitely a big disappointment and honestly doesn't merit to be called a ""W"" hotel at all. Beside of far too small rooms, the hotel's general business policy towards guests seems to be ""grab everything you can and run!"". Parking did cost more than in New York and Wifi rates were just a rip-off par excellence. Better go to the ACE hotel where you get for the same price a room twice as big and much more competent and willing staff!Paid $369 a night and no free Wi-Fi !! Why can I sit in a McDonald's and get free Wi-Fi and not at this nice hotel?? There was no coffee pot in the room which I thought was odd. The bed was very comfy but all it had on it was a sheet and a ""Duvet of Death"" which weighed about 20 lbs. Wish they had another choice of blanket. Another odd thing was the maid came everyday at 4:30pm for turn down service. We were always scrambling around at this time getting ready for dinner so we sent her away. Altogether, it was a nice trip to Seattle but I prefer the Sheraton.My husband and I arrived at the W at 4:40 to check-in (check-in time is 3pm.) There were many people waiting in line ahead of us, and I noticed everyone was being told their rooms were not ready. Luggage was being taken by the desk clerks and assembled near the entrance to the bay of elevators...wouldn't a bell desk be helpful for that?? When it was finally our turn to check-in we were told that our room would be ready in an hour to an hour and a half! This wasn't going to work for us because we had dinner reservations and needed to change. We were told to stand off to the side and they would see what could be done. After about 10 to 15 minutes we were told we could have the keys to our room. We appreciate this, but really didn't expect to have to wait. We have stayed at many hotels in Seattle on Saturday nights, and have never been told our room may not be ready until 6pm!! The corner ""Fabulous"" room was nice, but had TERRIBLE lighting. We were also dismayed to discover in the morning that there wasn't a coffee pot in the room. We will never stay at the W Seattle again, and look forward to our next Saturday night in Seattle at the Grand Hyatt!Hotel has great location and great feel, but falls short of expectaions for a W property. Lobby is crazy....never seemed to be enough desk staff to handle hoards of people with luggage everywhere. Staff was nice and helpful, just needed more of them. Lounge area in downstairs lobby was generally unkempt with lots of trash and our room looked a little tired and could have used some paint touch up, etc. On the positive side, room amenities...Bliss products...were awesome!As most of us do now we read the previous reviews for the W Seattle prior to booking our stay, so we knew to expect the dim lighting in the hallways, the fee for the internet in the rooms and the trendy bar type scene at night in the lobby. All minor things in our opinion.
We booked this hotel based on location, value for money, and the overall appearance of the rooms and amenties. 
Our room had all the modcons you expect from any hotel these days. TV, fridge, couch, comfy beds and pillows, a huge selection of bathroom amenities, mini bar, and so on. There was even a music cd to play and a trendy clock radio and ipod charger. Unfortunately not compatible to the iphone which would have been really handy.
However the housekeeping let us down. For the first 2 nights we had to request them to come and makeup our room after we returned late in the day to find it unserviced.
On the third day we actually spoke to the lobby staff and asked them to ensure our room was madeup before we got back as we were going on a day trip and would be tired . The staff not only ensured this was done but gave us a complimentary cheese and desert platter and a card advising they hoped we had a great trip down to Mt Rainier. A wonderful thought which really made up for the previous days lack of service.
If we ever return to Seatlle we would look for alternate accommodation as we have never had to ask for housekeeping in all our travels throughout the world and have stayed in hotels with much lower rating and received better service.
Overall just an average experience that could have been excellent with better attention to detail. It was very dissapointing to find the room not mad up on day 2 after our request the day before. We thought that after having a problem the staff would have addressed it.Stayed at the ""W"" in Seattle for 2 nights to compare to other Starwood properties. I found the hotel very average for the following reasons:
1). hotel lobby poorly designed (you have to navigate around guests checking in to reach elevators)
2). front counter check-in person did not advertise any hotel amenities when checking in 
3). no signage at front desk for VIP/starwood members, front counter staff always having to ask if anyone is in line to jump ahead
4). hotel floors so dimly lit you can barely make out room direction signs
5). so called ""fabulous rooms"" have three tiny drawers to put clothes
While these were fairly minor details (did not ruin our stay in Seattle), I thought I would pass these along to the general manager. I sent an email indicating that for value, I did not beleive the ""W"" provided the ""WOW"" factor for the price I was spending. I indicated that I would welcome any feedback or any recommendations for future stays in Seattle (hint hint nudge nudge indicating that I would give ""W"" another chance). I received an email from guest relations apologizing for the inconvenience and offering 5000 starwood points.
Well on the positive, they did offer some time of compensation. However, I was quite surprised they didn't want us to return.
So much for the ""WOW"" factor.We stayed at this hotel while going to some games and walking around the city. Brought our dog with us. $25 per night, not bad, had a nice dog bed and a couple of dog bowls and two cookies, she loved all of those! Check-in was very fast, as it should be, valet parked the car. The room was very nice from the moment you walk in. The bed was very comfortable and clean. Bath clean and selection of amenities for bubble bath and lotion, as in other hotels too. We and our dog loved the stay there! The internet charge was kinds like 14.95 per day, they should include it on the room rate. Parking will cost you $37 per night you stay at the hotel, was reasonable taking in consideration we were walking around the city, and you can take the car in and out, as many times as you like or need. You'll enjoy your stay, if you get a room like ours. We chose the spectacular room, which it was exactly that!Nice stay.
Great beds.
Very clean.
$45 for valet parking after taxes .... and you must valet park.
Right down town ...easy to walk anywhere.
Nice staff.
Fred Meyer has Free WIFI .... but the W hotel does NOT. :( $5 / hour. That is the one thing negative we have.We were in town for the Rock n Roll Half Marathon so the location of our hotel was extremely important. We wanted to be within walking distance of everything to maximize what we could do and see in our 4 short days in Seattle. The W Hotel has an incredible location that will put you close to everything. The rooms are absolutely amazing with everything that is first class and all the comforts you would want and need. I do have a few issues with the front desk staff - just not very friendly at all - and the fact that there is no business center available on the weekend at all. And it doesn't open until 9 a.m. on Monday morning. I would highly recommend that you bring your own laptop if you need to stay in touch with the office or family over the weekend.I want to love the W, all of them. The W Seattle is a beautiful hotel. Beautiful design, trendy lobby, cool bar, great rooms, fantastic location.
But I do have some issues. The only smile from we saw on a staff member was the woman who checked us in and one of the valets. Everyone else seemed so grumpy and unhappy. This might be petty, but where are you supposed to hang your used towel? We stayed 4 nights and they never replenished the soap/shampoo. $13 for a gin & tonic. 
We were booked here for a week, which started over a very busy weekend in Seattle (all hotels in the area were very expensive). The problem is that we were booked at the very expensive rate for the whole week. I went online and saw that I could book the room for Mon-Thur for 40% of the rate we were paying. I went to the desk and asked them to adjust the rate for those nights. They flat out refused, period, no negotiating. Fine, that's not a problem, we just checked out. Sure we had to pack up and move to another equally nice hotel, but a small price to pay. Took the huge savings and spent the money at some of the wonderful restaurants that Seattle has to offer.For the past 5 years with my company, I've been on the road nearly 45 weeks a year. I've stayed at all brands, but prefer the W, JW Marriott, or Sheraton brands. After working a lot in Seattle over the past couple of years, I've been staying at the W Hotel in downtown. I have routinely found it to be one of the finest hotels, if not the best hotel in the entire Pacific Northwest. The rooms are excellent, very nicely appointed, and the attention to detail with cleanliness is second to none. They've got great food, the proper adult beverages, and the place is always lively and very entertaining. This is a place where you can enjoy yourself both during and after business.
The reason for this posting is that my interactions with the desk staff and hotel management, while they resolved a problem that I created, was absolute confirmation to the professionalism and ""can-do"" spirit I've come to expect and appreciate from The W in Seattle. I was so impressed by the positive attitude and the follow up help by the hotel's manager, that I would recommend this property to any business traveler. You can find nice rooms at a lot of fine hotels, but attitude and positive demeanor towards your guests is what sets apart the four/five star hotels above the rest. The W's management has found the right formula, and it shows to your guests. Every business and social/vacation traveler should take advantage of every opportunity to book at the W Hotel in Seattle. I was so impressed with my outstanding experience I told the desk staff and manager I would follow up with a written note of appreciation. The W Hotel, what a great find! Please contact me if you have any questions. Thanks. RTLWe stayed at the W, the night of the U2 concert. I had booked well in advance and paid well in advance - almost $350. Requested a king size room for my husband and me - even chose one of the higher level of rooms.
Imagine my surprise to end up in room right off of the elevator bay, with two full size beds, overlooking the upper story of another building downtown. Glad it wasn't our honeymoon.
When I called the front desk to inquire, I was told ""You booked on expedia, which means we only need to provide a room for you.""
Of course, no one bothers to tell you that when you're reserving AND paying in advance. And of course, they rely on the small print that says that they'll do their best but can't guarantee your requests will be honored, but this was ridiculous... to go from requesting a king room to a room where I can't even share a bed with my husband is, in my opinion, the absolute bottom of customer service. 
I will never stay at another W, and I will give the same advice to anyone who asks for recommendations. Hope it was worth it to them.Reliable service and amenities as with any W hotel. You can rely on this hotel for clean rooms, soft beds and pleasant service. The room was a generous size though parking was a bit expensive (though not atypical from other hotel parking rates). Hotel was centrally located and was within walking distance to sights.I stayed here last week for three nights for a work event and I'm really happy they booked this location (versus the last company offsite). I arrived at 11 p.m. and was greeted warmly and professionally at the front desk. I was a bit overwhelmed when I walked in because the vibe is a whole lot hipper than I'm used to. The first thing I tweeted was that I'm just not cool enough to stay there. Showing my Starwood Preferred Guest card to the gentleman checking me in I was given a better room, which I always appreciate. I have a king size bed at home; I do not want to sleep in a double regardless of where I am. Getting off the elevators I had a bit of a hard time finding my room because the lighting situation is quite ... intimate. Getting to the room, I was very pleased. Beautiful crisp white linens, great window seat, lots of task lighting if I needed it. One of the ways I rate hotels is if the room is better than what I have at home. On that level, I was really pleased with the bathtub. A lot of hotels - yes, even those four star properties - put really shower, standard issue tubs in their bathrooms. I have no idea why. Not so with the W. After a long day of work and travel I was able to take a nice, hot relaxing bath in a deep tub that wasn't overly aggressive about draining for my safety. I also really enjoyed the Bliss bath products as I had forgotten my Lush face wash at home. The one thing I would have appreciated about the room was if the iPod docking stations had been updated to charge iPhones. Unfortunately they didn't so I had to crawl behind a side table to plug my charger in. That said, overall, I really enjoyed the hotel. I also enjoyed the space used for our work event and that the WiFi there was free (unfortunately it was $40 for my stay in my room). If I was going to Seattle for pleasure, I'd probably go back to the Alexis Hotel or Inn at the Market, but if someone told me they'd booked the W I'd tell them they were in for a good stay.I've stayed at hotels all over the Seattle Metropolitan area, and the W is by far my favorite. The staff is wonderful, the rooms are fabulous (the most comfortable beds), the amenities are over the top, and you can get pretty much whatever, whenever. The staff is the most professional and the restaurant and bar is great. The location is right in the heat of Seattle and they offer transportation in the city. They have definitely won over my loyalty!Very dark in the rooms. Great for sleeping, not so good for working. Felt like i wanted to put in 100 watt lite bulbs to see my clothes. Pillows are amazing, so good I ended up buying one. Currently renovating so services like restaurant are suffering.The W Hotel is centrally located downtown and not too far of a walk from the shopping district. It's a very chic hotel with not much of a lobby. The room itself was great and felt very roomy. I liked the layout, with a king bed and by the window, there was a seating area. The bed was very comfortable, although I did find the pillows a little too soft for me. I loved The Bliss products that were provided, I definitely felt spoiled staying here. In the afternoon, if you need a little pick me up, go down to the lobby and enjoy some biscottis. Yum! 
The one thing that I would mention that could be improved was the lighting. The hotel was darkly lit, as was the elevator and hallways. It felt like it was 3am all the time. 
I would come back here in a heartbeat.I stayed at W a couple of times attending company meetings. The location is very good (just blocks from Convention Center) and close to everything.
The service is very good and the staff very friendly. The room is very nice and during my last trip I had the luck to be in one with a nice view to the space needle.
Although I didn't have enough time, on the ground floor sometimes you will find a DJ playing music while you have a drink, really cool.After booking my 2 night stay in November, I proceeded to read the reviews here, and I became a little nervous. After reading so many comments regarding poor upkeep and poor customer service, I thought, ""What did I get myself into?"" However, my trepidations were immediately quelled upon my arrival. The front desk staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The room was well appointed, and very clean. The bathroom was spotless, and the Bliss toiletries were wonderful! The hotel is very secure in that elevator access to floors can only be activated by an unexpired room key. My husband and I had a nice peaceful stay and 2 nights of quiet sleep. I am definitely staying there again!My family stayed at the W Hotel Seattle Thanksgiving evening and had a wonderful dinner together. The next morning, we took a walk around Seattle before checking out. Right as we entered our rooms, my daughter immediately noticed her new i Phone was missing from the nightstand. We tore the room apart and didn't find it. Upon checking out, we inquired about the hotel's ability to see if anyone entered our room when we were gone that morning. Hours later, I got a call from their Director of Security and he confirmed housekeeping was in our room...""for half of a second."" They did nothing about it...not even checking the housekeeper's belongings. Even the police agree that it is very suspicious but there is nothing they can do since we have to actual proof. The hotel knows this so they do nothing about it. We have stayed at the W Hotel in San Diego last month and the W Seattle last week. We were going to book a New York trip for Thanksgiving next year but we will not be staying there. Even in nice hotels, thefts happen as we have learned. I am very disappointed that the W Hotel Seattle turned their backs on us and didn't even care or make it right. BEWARE!The W hotel in Seattle is really well located, within walking distance of pikes place and various other tourist attractions. The hotel staff are friendly, the vibe is slightly posh and the hotel has an old money feel to it. The bar in the lounge area serves fantastic cocktails and a nice touch is the drinks in the lobby area that are free.Stayed at the hotel in November for a business trip. 
Location: fantastic, a block from a light rail station, and walkable to great restaurants and sights
Gym: good size, has free weights, machines, and 10 or so cardio machines. Would have liked kettle balls and an ab machine. 
Service: great, very friendly and prompt. 
Rooms: got upgraded to the 23rd floor, so had a great view. Room was clean but some drawbacks: no hooks on closet door or behind bathroom door to hang anything, no outlets near windowsill couch, digital alarm clock would be better. 
Overall, loved my stay.I go up to Seattle a few times a year for business and mostly stay at the W Seattle. If I have some spare time, I like to take a walk down to the shopping area, its pretty close to restaurants. Easy to find, valet parking available. The lobby is a little funky at night, but in a cool way. I've had drinks in their bar and lounge area before, nice vibe. The room was comfortable, nice flat screen, bathroom was a good size. Although they need to do something about the shower curtain. Its too short and has no weights in the bottom of it and is constantly blowing back on me. Next time I'll make sure to ask for a room with a separate shower stall. Plus it has a straight shower bar, they need to install the curved ones. Apart from that, the stay was great. Definitely going back.Went to Seattle for Thanksgiving stayed at the W. Great beds so comfortable, the Ocean and Earth Restaurant had great service and great food. The rooms are a nice size and the staff is very helpful. This was our third time staying at the W and enjoyed it again. This is our favorite place to stay in Seattle.This is my FAVORITE W Hotel in the States! The rooms are awesome- great views of the city! 
Top 10 things I love about this W property:
1.) Great location walking distance to most of where you want to go in DT Seattle
2.) The rooms are modern and well done
3.) Beds are incredibly comfortable (of course)
4.) Bathrooms have plenty of room, big tub, great shower water pressure and Bliss products
5.) The staff including housekeeping, front desk and the concierge were all great
6.) Gym was solid for a hotel gym
7.) The W bar is right downstairs - great atmosphere for hanging out
8.) Acuras shuttle you around
9.) Great service from all staff members
10.) Clean, clean, clean hotel
I won't stay anywhere else in Seattle.The W always delivers stylish interiors, fantastic rooms and excellent service. From their valet, to their wait staff at the restaurant, the service was exceptional and outstanding.This hotel was nice and suited all of our needs for a weekend in Seattle. However, I would not describe this hotel as ""over the top"" in any area. The room was very spacious but the bathroom was a bit small. The Bliss bathroom products get a ""thumbs up"" with thick shea butter lotion and a separate face scrub. They offer overnight parking advertised at $37 per night, but after taxes it is over $45! We spent more on parking than we did on the car rental itself. I will say that we would not have rented a car except we had to make a few trips out to the suburbs over the weekend.There really is no need for a car if you are staying in the city. The biggest highlight of the entire stay was the food. We ordered room service three times, and ate dinner at Earth & Ocean one night. Everything we ate was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and delicious! The biggest downside of the stay was getting in touch with the staff. Even before I arrived in Seattle, I called to ask questions, and could not get through to anyone. I even sent an email to Whatever/Whenever that was never returned. When we arrived, we called room service a few different times and it just rang and rang. However, once we got them on the phone, it was smooth sailing. The same went for the front desk. When I arrived at the hotel, I did not know that the parking/valet was located on the side of the building, so I called the front desk while sitting on 4th avenue to find out where to go. The phone just rang and rang. 
I would stay here again because the published rate was great for the location. The only suggestion I may make is that the staff be a bit more accessible.I travel the country weekly and stay in a variety of hotels and locations. The W Hotel in downtown Seattle is my favorites. The staff is exceptional. They are always more than willing to assist with anything needed. They even have a hot line phone extension in the room that you can ask for just about anything, and they will make it happen. Great location, great people, great atmosphere, bar and restaurant.........would recommend it to anyone going to Seattle................ 5 StarStart to finish they got everything right! Not to mention our dog is spoiled forever! It started with letting them know it was a birthday getaway...they surprised us with an upgrade to a ""Fabulous"" room and then a yummy cake was sent to our room with a card signed by several members of their staff! Our dog, Boots, was not left out and he received some dog biscuits shaped like a ""w""! Thank you to W for making our dreams come true and we will be back!Stayed April 13-16, Todd checked us in with a smile! Went to Earth and Ocean every morning and had the Northwest Bounty, Crab, mixed mushroom and poached eggs. Delicious! Nick was our server and always attentive and friendly. Cocktails were really good and order the W Sexy fries, Penn Cove mussels and Wild Shrimp. A real Food Fest! Later, had dinner with Jen. She took on our party of 5 with humor and outstanding service! Room was spacious we were able to see Downtown Seattle lights. So Gorgeous! Thanks W! You took excellent care of us.I was so excited to take my wife to the W for our anniversary. Unfortunately, the hotel was nothing of what was expected from the photos and other reviews. The hotel is old and the elevators continually whiz up and down all night and you get to hear them the whole time. When other rooms are taking a shower, thats right, you here it. The room was small, lacked all hope for trendy and upscale, and was layed out like a Best Western. 
Valet parking was awful. I understand it is Seattle and parking is like oil, expensive. However, to bleed your paying guests out of $45 (including tax) a day to park, you should look at some other options. 
Another fee to add to the fun, use of the fitness center! 
The only bright spot was location. It was easy to walk to any place we wanted. Unfortunately at their concierge, the girl giving directions was off on one of our locations by six blocks. Another time we asked for the nearest US Bank and were sent to the convention center (several bloacks away). Later that weekend we walked one block down from the hotel and surprise there was a US Bank. - Once again, lacking in ""spectacular"".
To summarize I would say you would be better off spending your $725.97 where you can get a good night sleep, better parking, a nicer room, and real ""whenver, wherever"" (their signature phrase) treatment. I hope this helps because in this economy I think all of us, wealthy, middle class, and poverty, deserve to have a great experience when we are spending our money that we have worked hard for.This was really disappointing and not up to the standards of other W's I've stayed at. Upon checking into our room (travelling with a buddy) we noticed that the top sheets on not one but both of the beds had tears on them. Worried that we'd further rip the sheets while sleeping, we called and had housekeeping change them out.
We then noticed the desk had some sort of dried gunk on it in a couple spots (leftover dried sauce from food?) The same desk was really beat up and scuffed, too.
The next morning, after my shower, the tub wouldn't drain and the bath was filled with about 1/2 a foot of the shower water. As such my friend couldn't take a shower. So we went out and told the guy at the desk about the issue, which he promised to address. He gave us 2 free drink tickets for the lounge, which was fine, if underwhelming. (""We can't really do anything else for you because your room was pre-paid"") A comp night on the expensive parking ($45 a night) would've helped. Not being able to shower in your room is a fairly major inconvenience.
I imagine Starwood must have plans to redo this W soon, because it's really starting to feel faded and worn. I'm sure there is better value for $$ in the 4-Star range in Seattle. Cheers!The hotel is nice. Good service, great location, comfy beds. It is a good hotel. But, for a W, it is lacking. Design buffs will expect more from the rooms. There is not anything to set them apart.I have stayed here twice. Once for work and once with my Wife for leisure. It's a great hotel and like all W hotels pretty stylish and comfy. The first time we stayed we did have to move rooms however due to some very noisy youngsters having a party in the room next door. Location is OK, but nothing in the immediate area. Everything is within walking distance though. Nice bar with some great tunes (live DJ). I got a great deal on price using my corporate code...about $160, so definitely worth every penny.I loved this hotel. When you walk in there are oversized couches and a large fireplace in the lobby which make you feel like you just walked into your house. The concierge is extremely accomodating. The decor is uber chic and trendy. The bar is also downstairs next to the lobby - very open room. The rooms are small in size but chic and comfortable, especially the bed. Views from the room are great - looking on downtown Seattle. Great room service and staff also!I stay several times a year in the Seattle area, this was my first stay at this W. And as long it is under the current management and in the current condition, be assured this to be my last!
The room was dirty. Stains of all sorts on the wall, shower was digusting, dust all over the place. The room itself has nothing W-styled. While the living room shows a moder atmosphere, the room I stayed in was worn out, a while ago.
Most staff cared, but the person that worked the night of my check out prefered finishing his newspaper article over attending the front desk. This is so not ""W""...
I sent a mail to the management of this hotel, and being an SPG platunum member I had hoped to receive more than a standardised template-mail. Dissapointed in the W brand, as they can let this happen. Not even a formal apology, no compensation, so no repeat business. 
Thanks SPG has a Westin in Bellevue, that is well managed and maintained...I visited the W Seattle for a weekend stay prior to a conference. I've always enjoyed my stays at W Hotels, and the W Seattle upheld this tradition. 
Arrived via the Light Link Train from the Sea-Tac airport. This has an easy commute and a great bargain for only $2.50 fare per person. The University station is only one block from the W hotel entrance. 
If you like the vibe of the W Hotels, you'll enjoy a stay here. The Seattle W is one of the more 'subdued' of the W family, but it's still very much a W - lots of great architecure near the hotel. Seattle Library (amazing modern design) and the grand Olympic hotel on the opposite side. The W building itself is a striking building, bands of dark glass alternating with white facade of the building - topped with a metal mesh pyramid on the roof - very easy to spot from all over the city.
I arrived at the hotel around 2:30 and was greeted by a lovely and professional young woman at the Welcome Desk. She graciously upgraded me to a 'spectacular' room, which are found on the higher floors (for a better view). The lobby was lovely - nice earth tone funiture, an inviting fireplace, with soaring ceilings.
My room was on the 15th floor, facing 4th street and Elliott Bay water view. The style of the rooms and corridors was consistent with other W's - hip, modern style with an aura of cool luxury. Room was quite spacious, spotlessly clean and everything was in perfect working order. I particularly loved the sofa seat in the window. I could sit there and relax while enjoying the city view. A/C -ventilation worked well. I never heard any noise from others in the hotel. The W bed is decadant - couldn't wait to get into the bed each nice - loved the sheets and the pillows! The bathroom was very large - the towels, bathrobe, and toileties were so luxurious. 
Used the Sweat Fitness Center two times - wonderful facility with top-notch equipment and super-clean.
Took advantage of the free Wheels service for a ride to the Olympic Sculpture park - awesome ride and very professional service.
Room was serviced very well and timely.
Ate at the hotel's restaraunt - Earth & Ocean for one dinner and both breakfasts - it was awesome. The duck and charcuterie plates were fabulous - provided the best dinner that I had for my entire Seattle trip. The adjacent bar had a nice happy hour in the late afternoon and again in the late evening - awesome drinks - loved the lemon drop in particular.
Only negatives that come to mind are rather insignificant:
I could never find the concierge at the desk in the Living Room - I didn't really need his/her services, but it would have been nice to get a city walking map. Also, the Acura service closed at 5:00p.m., it would have been nice to have it as an option for transport to evening activities.
All staff that I encountered at this hotel were polite and friendly, I had a fun and relaxing stay here!I have stayed at this location several times and loved it - this has been my regular business and leisure hotel in Seattle for over 5 years, and despite them not having a bliss spa like some other Ws the staff and rooms have been great. Up to now. Something has changed and I don't know why. They seem to be resting a little too much on their laurels and are getting shoddy. The Acura service is still great, and the folks doing it seem to be on top of it- I wish they ran other aspects of the hotel. I am right in the target demographic for Ws so am not going to be one of those who complains that it is too dark/hip etc. I get and love the W concept, but this location has either become way too hip in its own mind, or has too many 20 somethings running the place and staying there on expense accounts. I Called down 3 times at 2 am one night to complain about the drunk kids running around and yelling obcenities in the hallways. The person answering the phone appeared to be amused. Perhaps so, but I think it is reasonable to expect some sleep at a hotel and ask security to take care of it. On two consecutive mornings requests for follow up wakeup calls were ignored. Rooms look dirty, dated and worn and show signs of previous guests. Stains on the carpet and the window seats. Scratches and sticky goopy material on wall (like coke or tobacco tried not to look to closely). Bathrooms dated and showers dripping and worn. After the reaction from staff to basic requests (like directions etc.) I just didn't bother trying to get any help - it was clear they didn't really care or want to be bothered with guest issues. All in all, this has been my go to hotel in Seattle for business for the last 5 years, but I will likely be moving elsewhere for the next visit. If you need a starwood property the sheraton and Westin are much more centrally located, and the Sheraton especially seems to be working hard at its customer service. The new staff at the W tries way too hard to be hip before tring to be helpful. Check out a few other Ws around the country and see how they get both of those elements right. There are much better values available in Seattle for the price point,it's one of the best hotel i stayed at. Well designed rooms. Big. Very relaxing!The W was nice, but not as nice as expected....I don't think it quite lives up to it's reputation, at least not this location. It's nice looking but a bit away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Also the bar downstairs was not as happening as I had hoped, and there wasn't much to do in the lounge. The rooms were a bit smaller than what I was used to, however the bathroom was a really good size. The one thing that annoyed me was housekeeping because I had to wait about 45 min two mornings in a row just for towels. If I had to, I would stay here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.I've stayed here several times over the last couple of years, and quite like the W Seattle. It's a very chic, very trendy hotel with a great location, but the prices are a bit steep. The staff is very professional and efficient, from the valet, to the doorman, to the front desk.
The decor is very 'design hotel' and the theme is dark and cool. It extends to the corridors and rooms. The room decor is dark purples and blues. This is actually a really good idea in Seattle, since come summertime, the sun is up early and down late. It makes sleeping a lot easier. They have the W/Sheraton ""Heavenly"" bed, which is just that... :) I've seriously considered buying one for home, they're so comfortable. The bathrooms, on the other hand, are only mediocre.
Overall, I think it's a pretty average value, and would stay here again.We booked this hotel for attending U2 concert. It was the second time we stayed at W Seattle. The hotel is still living up to our expectations. I loved its bathroom, very spacious. The concierge lady was very friendly and helpful.
We read previous reviews about parking at W Seattle. When we arrived, the hotel parking was full. Luckily, a public parking lot/building was right next door at $31 per day (tax included). So, if the parking at W was really $45, we saved $14 bucks and the parking was right beside W.My wife and I recently stayed at the W Seattle prior to a cruise to Alaska. Not having been to Seattle before, I wasn't sure what to expect and what hotels would best suit our needs. We found the W Seattle to be an excellent choice. It was located right in the downtown area close to shopping and restaurants. About 5 blocks from Pikes Market. The room was very comfortable and well furnished. We particularly liked the window sofa. My wife also enjoyed the complimentary coffee in the lobby. Another feature that turned out to be a real benefit was the Acura Experience. The hotel and Acura provide transportation in a MDX for trips in the immediate area. We took advantage of the service and they provided us transportation to the cruise terminal. When we returned from the cruise and took a taxi, the fair was about $20. After our cruise, we stayed at the Fairmont in downtown Seattle which we were not aware of when we booked the room is directly across the street from the W Seattle. It was very nice and the service was also great, but the price of the W Seattle was less, basically located in the same area and provided complementary coffee. We were surprised that the Fairmont didn't provide the coffee. Our view from the W Seattle was also better. When we return to Seattle, we would definitely chose the W Seattle again.We had a great time at the W! They were so attentive to our needs. I mentioned that is was our first night away from our baby and they upgraded us to a king corner luxury room. The staff was incredibly friendly and went out of their way to ensure all our needs were met. The location was within walking distance to all the great things downtown Seattle has to offer. Great stay, we'll be back!I have stayed a few W Hotels in the past and this one in Seattle was disappointing. The rooms were pretty bare and minimalist and the walls and desk were all scuffed up and a bit dingy looking. The bathroom was nice and the room was clean so that outweighed the athestic factors for me. The W beds are always very comfortable so after a long day of walking and sightseeing we were glad to have a good nights sleep. The location was great and we ate at a fabulous restaurant that was a half block away (Shuckers). All in all it was a good stay but I was disappointed that the hotel was not up to the typical W standards.Wife and I stayed for a night in a corner suite on second to top floor. Had a great view of Elliott Bay through buildings and the rest of downtown from a great vantage point. The large windows and comfortable furniture provided a great feel.
What really stood out for us was the service. Had flowers delivered and forgot to order vases, but hotel staff had flowers delivered and without asking provided vases! The restaurant provided the best breakfast we've had in a long time at a hotel. We decided to come back for the lunch and we're again surprised by the great meal. Perfect portion sizing and just a delicious treat.
We walked to the Seattle Art Museum to enjoy the picasso exhibit that's touring the world. The concierge recommended a walk over a cab and he was right, it was a pleasant walk and gave us a good feel for the city.
All in all, a great hotel in a great city with fantastic staff. And, unlike most W hotels, this W was not too dark and instead had well lit hallways and public spaces. It certainly didn't give the feeling of entering a night club in full swing when we returned late in the evening. We usually prefer Westins over W's, but this W was definitely a more enjoyable and intimate than the Sheraton and Westin in downtown Seattle.
I'd highly recommend for business or pleasure. This is our new favorite starwood property in Seattle.My friends and I were really excited to stay at the W during our girls trip, however the hotel didnt meet our expectations. The only thing that was great about the stay was the location. The front staff was friendly, however calling down for any assistance was alittle frustrating. Requesting towels took forever, generally very slow in responding. The rooms were a decent size, the beds were not the most comfortable. The whole parking issue was frustrating, 3 different prices being shown but you end up paying $48 a night. I would recommend this hotel to older couples who prefer a quiet place where not much is going on.There is absolutely no way this property should fall into the category of a 4 star hotel. We have stayed at numerous ""4 Star"" properties across Canada and the US and this one did not even come close. The entire place is dark and the ceilings in the guest rooms are low and claustrophobic. Our only view was straight into a guest window at the Faimont across the street. The staff albeit friendly, seemed to lack maturity and did not present in what we have come to know and appreciate in a four star property (ie: westin Seattle). The lobby full of young travellers, had the feel of a high end youth hostel rather than a 4 star hotel. So...if you are of a less discerning taste and can find a great deal on this property then the W Seattle is for you. If not, skip it!Just finished my first stay at a W brand hotel and was very disapointed. The bathroom was dirty with visible mold/mildew on the grout on the tiled shower. We were stiffed on our bathroom toiletries. When I tried to call housekeeping to request the missing toiletries the phone in the room didn't work. The walls are thin (there must have been a party going on in the adjoining room). The bed was uncomfortable and there were no extra blankets (with a lighter weight than duvet) or pillows to use. Also $11 for a room service milkshake? Give me a break! If the hotel was fancy enough to warrant a milkshake that expensive that would be a wholly different story. Do yourself a favor and stay at the hyatt or Monaco for a much better experience.
As an aside, I highly recommend the ""Mod"" pizza place around the corner, great pizza with great prices!I travel to Seattle often for business and this hotel is a very good value. I use the Starwood website to get a consistent rate. The front desk is nice enough to upgrade me when possible. The hotel is in a good location for getting around the city. The rooms are large, the restaurant is good for breakfast, and I cannot complain.Very nice location, well appointed modern design rooms. Fabulous bedThis hotel had listed at one rate only to find out at the last day that they had charged me a much higher rate - twice as high. I had booked this because of the attractive advertised rate, but when I checked out, turns out it wasn't so attractive at all. 
I also think the W is way overhyped. It looks fancy but you will get the same quality at any other downtown hotel. Not worth the money in any case.
Business Center was not open on weekends even though they told me to come down in the morning on Sat and print what i needed.
Don't stay here!I have stayed at this hotel many times. The room was nice, clean and the robes were fabulous. I did not like the gym which I used daily. The gym looked like it had not been cleaned in months. There were no bacterial wipes to clean off machines after use. It was very hot in the gym with no ceiling fans or good ventilation. 
Staff was great and very helpful. They messed up my bill and could not remedy it when I checked out because the person in charge was off on Saturday.Only stayed for one night. Love the Bliss products provided (shampoo, conditioner, face wash, shower gel, lotion). Location was great and I agree with the positive reviews about the hotel. I just have one issue - why is it so freaking dark in the hallways?I do not see how anyone could even think of leaving a negative review. Stayed here April 28 for two nights for my bachelorette weekend. The concierge was amazing and gave us the lowdown on all the hotspots for eating and partying. Love love love the modern feel. I would look no further if you want an amazing stay close to shopping and playing, for a super reasonable price!We weren't really fans of this hotel. As many other reviews have mentioned, it was VERY dark. Even the rooms themselves didn't have a ton of light. My husband's comment that ""we aren't vampires"" summed it up perfectly. The service was good. The location is ok, it was a bit far from some of the shopping destinations we wanted but probably fine for others. Our view was horrible - we looked onto a parkade next door. We were really close to it, if we didn't close the blinds, people could definitely see us changing. The room was tiny and the layout was odd - we felt like we were frequently tripping over things (i.e. chairs, etc.). Internet access was available in the lobby for free which is a definite plus. We got the room on priceline for $105, which was ok but I wouldn't pay more to stay at this hotel again.Boutique type hotel which appeals to a younger upscale hip market. The rooms are not inexpensive. The clientele seems to be young professionals. Very tasteful and Updated We noticed many gay people during our stay.My friends and I wanted to enjoy a New Years Eve at the W Hotel lounge and so we booked a couple of their ""Cool Corner"" suites and invited folks to come join us. From the moment of check-in I was greeted with rudeness by the hotel staff there, which is completely uncharacteristic of Starwood hotels. In particular, the ""Guest Service Manager"" Brian B. was about as friendly as your average Kinko's worker (that's not that friendly, btw). I have always liked the bar at the W Hotel and I guess have been fortunate to have not interacted much with the hotel staff up until now. I'll be putting friends and business colleagues up at the Four Seasons or Hotel 1000 from now on.We stayed at the W Seattle in December as part of our holiday season/vacation. I really can't find anything wrong with this hotel property. The staff was very courteous and friendly. The valet couldn't be more professional and helpful. The front desk immediately recognized that we were SPG Gold and upgraded us to superior room on the 24th floor with a great view of Macy's star and Space Needle. The rooms were very clean and well laid out. The furniture very sheik. It made you feel that everything in the room was personalized to your taste, like having your own interior designer. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows very fluffy. The bathroom was large and had plenty of amenities. It was very quiet and it felt like we were the only ones in the hotel during our stay. The hotel was walking distance (2-3 blocks) to Seattle’s shopping district where there is plenty to see, eat, shop, and do.
Couple of minor things that may have been an issue during our stay - the hotel entrance was a little tough to find and the valet/parking daily rate was expensive - $44/day. I also found the lobby to be a bit small... Other than that, I highly recommend the W to travelers to Seattle.This was my second W Hotels stay. My first stay was at the W Chicago City Center in 2009. I loved that stay, as the hotel was beautiful, modern, but very comfortable! The W Seattle, however fell short by the standards set by the W Chicago.
My understanding is that the W Seattle is one of the earliest W's built and opened, and that it's the least ostentatious of the properties. Indeed, the room didn't feel very 4 star. The wood decor was chipping and pealing, the bathroom was dirty with a broken showerhead, and there was little of the whimsical enhancements from my previous W stay, just a bed, TV, and bathroom. The bed, was comfortable, as was to be expected from a Starwood property.
The Valet park took quite a bit of time, and I had to park on the street for 20 minutes with my hazards on - it was the middle of December, and the sign said full except for guests, so I'm not faulting them. Check in was easy, and I was upgraded to a Spectacular room. The desk clerk noted my previous W visit and assured me that they had added a coffee maker to my room. I'm used to having one in my room, and the Chicago W made sure to round one up for me, and promised that there would always be one when I returned t other hotel. I was expecting this in Seattle, however, there was no coffee maker in my room. A call to the whatever, whenever service revealed a person who said frankly, 'the W doesn't have coffeemakers, but let me see what I can do."" She never called back. 
Positives included the restaurant, which did a custom vegan tasting meal for my friend. The staff was exceptional, and the food was seasonal, inspired, and delicious. I highly recommend Earth and Ocean whether you stay at the W or not. 
In all, I can't see the value in the W compared to the Westin (the original Starwood Westin flagship hotel) or the newly renovated Sheraton, or the Westin Bellevue. Seattle has some nice modern boutique hotels which have the polish, trip, and service down 100%, the W doesn't. The hotel is showing it's age (ironic for a hip hotel brand only a decade + in age). Particularly with the premium you pay for the W, I don't see why it should be a must-stay in Seattle. I didn't appreciate being promised something, and then when it didn't happen, I never got a response back from the staff. However, all customer service issues aside, the hotel just isn't hip enough to warrant the price.Full disclosure here, I love the W. I love that it's dark and moody, with tonnes of tea lights and my kind of chill music in the lobby and on a cd in the room. I love the Bliss toiletries, and the fact that the staff will give you an extra body butter or two if you ask nicely (one of the main reasons we keep going back actually - can't get enough Bliss products). I love the beds and the high end sheets. Because I love it all so much, I want the W to be great. So it bugs me when the bathroom isn't quite as clean as it could be when we arrive, and that the rooms are starting to look a bit tired with dings in the paint and on the furniture. And it especially bugs me when the concierge service is unfriendly. This is an expensive hotel, so the Whatever, Whenever service really needs to come with a smile. The front desk reception staff are usually pretty nice, as are the valets, housekeeping and other facilities staff, but the concierges could be reminded that they're there for more than looking cool. We go to Seattle a couple of times a year for a shopping/foodie weekend, and I really hope we keep feeling good about choosing the W for our stay. I really want to keep loving it...but there are other choices.We stayed at the W after finding a great rate online. When we arrived we asked for and were given a complimentary upgrade to a higher floor. The room was very comfortable with a long comfy window seat couch. The room had a very modern feel and was clean and well appointed. We enjoyed our visiting the lounge in the hotel lobby/restaurant for cocktails. The location was perfect for walking to Seattle Art Museum and Pike Street Market and it was a short taxi ride to train station which was our mode of travel this trip.
Our only issue was that the hotel website shows they have a business center on site that turned out to be closed on weekends (not stated on the website). The only free wifi in the hotel was in the small usually crowded lobby and we had decided to leave our laptop behind.There is nothing about this hotel that would bring me back! For the price I paid for a ""spectacular"" room, I expect much more than I got. The photos online are misleading at best! My room was small, bathroom unimpressive, and furniture lacking in quality. There are no drapes on the window, just faux wooden slat blinds that just don't do the trick when you're trying to sleep in on a vacation. The staff was curt and unfriendly. The parking is ridiculous at $37/night, mind you it's $44 after tax!! Noise insulation was also a problem. My ""stunning city view"" left a whole lot to be desired. Water pressure in the shower was weak. Oh yeah, If that's not enough, I've been charged double - once on my holding card and once on another card I checked in with! Seriously people! I've stayed in Holiday Inns WAY nicer than this at half the cost. For this price, there are lots of other hotels in the city that offer REAL luxury. Buh-Bye W!!We booked our stay via priceline.com and were very pleased with our accommodations. The location in Downtown Seattle is great, however parking IS expensive at the hotel so keep that in mind. There are nearby parking garages that are slightly less expensive, however you don't have the ability to go in and out. 
The service was great, the rooms were very clean and trendy. We also loved the fitness room. The only downside we had was our stay was too short and our view was of the neighboring parking garage. Other than that, it was perfect.This hotel is very dark in terms of lighting and colors. The doormen are dressed like bouncers instead of the tradition doorman attire. The lobby area was very dark and at night the lobby turns into a loud lounge. 
The hallways are also very dark. The rooms themselves were fine and nicely lit. Hotel has a good location but for the same price you can get a room at the Fairmont which is right on the next block.Our first stay at the W was very good. We arrived in Seattle on Sunday morning after our Alaskan cruise and were immediately given a room and were upgraded to a large room facing the Space Needle. There was a sofa the length of the Long window big enough for my husband and I to stretch out and read the Sunday paper. The hotel is a five minute walk to the Pike Place Market, a great way to spend a Sunday morning. We had two very good meals close by at Tulios restaurant excellent Italian food and a good local feel. Monday am we had breakfast at a French bakery at the FairmontWe booked a last minute room for 4 adults and the W was quick to accomodate us and we are so glad they did! Our room was on the 23rd floor, over-looking the city. The pillows were the softest pillows ever. The only negative thing I have to say is $44 for parking is expensive. If we are going to pay that much, at least wash the car :) Everything was perfect. The food, the service and the accomodations- all perfect.It was fairly simple - while booking online through Starwood's site for a room the night before Halloween to have a ""staycation"", I requested a room on a higher floor for better views of downtown Seattle. We had been stressed out a bit and were looking forward to feeling as much like we were getting away as possible while staying close to other responsibilities.
So I booked a ""Spectacular"" room, and when we checked in, was pleasantly surprised that the hotel had not only read the request, but had already booked us on the top floor of the hotel facing the side with the best views of downtown. No need for us to even ask at the desk.
Granted, this wasn't a weeknight where the availability might be less, but it created a better experience right off the bat for us.
Now if only they wouldn't insist we supply a refundable deposit on an umbrella that clearly came from a lost-and-found when it was pouring outside. A W-branded umbrella, sure, but a Sahalee Country Club umbrella? Come on!
One negative - paying a $4 ""delivery service"" charge AND a 22% F&B charge (presumably for delivery also) on top of $6 for a cup of room-service coffee. I say this somewhat in jest, of course, because overall we were very pleased.I went to Seattle for the very first time with my sisters and Mom(69) for a girls getaway. We're a very close family, but the girls are vastly outnumbered so we have been doing these trips for a few years.
None of us had ever been to Seattle, which is why we chose it. For the most part, some of us are very widely traveled.
The W was recommended to me by my son who travels to Seattle on business periodically, and he stays at the W. 
Pros:
The location was wonderful. We took the light rail from the airport ($2.50) and the University station was one block away at 3rd and Seneca. The hotel is at 4th and Seneca. We walked to a lot of places, and took the bus to many others. The free bus zone within the downtown area is terrific. We tried to spare my mom from too much walking, and we were able to do so at this hotel. We were upgraded to a ""spectacular"" room, which simply means it is on a higher floor, with better views. Our request for adjoining rooms was granted, and that made things more fun for us. The beds were very comfy with great pillows and comforters. Nice touches like bathrobes and terrific toileties. The rooms were nicely lit with plenty of lights and lamps. The bathroom was very spacious, and had a lighted makeup mirror with plenty of counter space. 
Pros:
The hotel is very dark inside. It feels like they are trying to be hip, but we all felt like it was too much. Trying to see the room numbers in the hallway was fun. 
We asked for 2 beds in each room, and they were double beds. Most hotels provide two Queens. Sharing with sisters was okay, but it would have been more comfortable with queen beds. I mean -who uses doubles anymore?
We paid a discounted corporate rate of $169, which was apparently a good price for Seattle. I read that the rack rate is much higher. We got free internet in the rooms, and that was very nice. Otherwise we would have had to hang out in the lobby to get free wireless. The staff was very helpful, which interestingly was a contrast to several very rude people we met in the city.
All in all we had a great time. The hotel definitely suited our needs, and we felt we got a good deal. I would recommend this hotel to others.A terrific place to stay - Central to everywhere, close to Pike's Market and shopping. The service is exceptional, the rooms are very spacious and well laid out and are finished to perfection. 
I checked-in very early in the morning and Katie (grave shift at welcome desk) was able to checked me in no problem. She is very friendly even though she works the late shift!
All of the staffs are so friendly. Thanks to Ms. Jennifer Lee at the welcome desk for making our stay so perfect!In downtown Seattle, spacious room, friendly services and modern renovation.The staff members were friendly and extremely helpful, from the bell service guys to the concierge, front desk staff, housekeepers, and room service deliverers. The concierge gave us a walking map and marked our routes for us. The room was what you'd expect from a W, comfortable and luxurious. The location was fantastic, within walking distance of the art museum, Pike Place Market, and very good restaurants.Just got back from a stay at the W. Hotel was fabulous. Easy to get to from the airport with the Light Rail, the University St. entrance is one block away at 3rd & Seneca.
I had always wanted to try a W, and was a little worried staying there with my 16-month-old son, but it worked out fabulous. Although their website said they didn't offer cribs, I got it added over the phone and there was one waiting for us. The bed was incredibly comfy, and the Bliss bathroom products were a welcome luxury. We were also upgraded to a higher room floor (perhaps due to SPG Gold status).
Two highlights for us were the Acura MDX car service and the Washington apples in the lobby. Very handy each day. They even had a car seat available for the baby. 
And the staff was always courteous and friendly. The MDX staff was great, and the Whatever/Whenever even assisted with getting tickets to the sold-out Sounders game. The best part is that my son fell in love with the little MDX squeeze toy in the room, and they gave us a brand new one for him to take home! So thoughtful. They wanted to charge for a fridge (for little one's food), but we were able to make room in the minibar, which was luckily not touch-sensitive.
Make sure you go across the street to Cafe Migliore for your coffee (skip the free stuff downstairs, blah). It was the best coffee I had all trip (and I made a point to try a latte at every new place I saw).
My only complaint is the cost of parking, because the Seattle Bus system is awful to rely on. There are some close garages that were cheaper. Earth and Ocean downstairs seemed priced for expense accounts only. Also, plan your Sunday activities well in advance, the area around the hotel was a ghost town after 2PM.I loved this hotel. It was hip, modern, and had a fun, youthful vibe. The rooms were clean and nice. The staff showed a great attention to detail.For the price of the room I could have stayed at much nicer and classier hotels. I had always imagined the W chain to be a 5 star establishment, but the standard room that I was booked into was 3 star at best. The room appeared recently remodeled, but was definitely not on par with the cost of staying there. Finishes were not typical of the high-end fixtures one would expect at the W. It appeared as if this hotel was getting by on name only, and travelers were willing to pay exorbitant prices to stay at this one in Seattle. The lobby however, was more impressive and very hip, catering to the 20-something crowd (I arrived on a weekend at night and the first floor reminded me of a packed club). Perhaps the hotel was trying to impress the X-generation with the lobby, thinking that most of them would be too trashed later to remember what the room looks like? Needless to say, I ended my stay at one night only and transferred to a true 5 star hotel nearby.My sister and I chose to stay at because we can use her Starwood points, but we got more than just a good hotel deal. The hotel, is not as centrally located as some of the other hotels in Downtown Seattle, but it is still walking distance to just about everything: Westlake Center, Pike Place Market, even Pioneer Square (ok, that was a loong walk, but it's doable) The hotel is also only a block away from the University Street stop of the Central Link Light Rail and has bus stops right by it so its very accessible. My sister and I did a lot of walking all over the city to see the sights and it was such a nice treat to come back to the hotel after our long and tiring day and be able to have a great night's sleep because the beds were so incredibly comfortable, we slept like babies! We couldn't stop talking about it after our trip and she's actually considering buying the bed, she said its better than the Westin's Heavenly bed, and she's a big fan of the Heavenly bed. There is no free WiFi in the rooms, but if you go downstairs to the lobby area, you can have Internet access for free. They are also accommodating, I was able to check in early and got a late check out as well! I loved Seattle and when I do come back, i will definitely stay here again! Oh the Bliss Spa toiletries were a definite bonus!My husband and I stayed at the W hotel in Seattle, and were pleasantly surprised by both the value for what we got, and the service at both the concierge desk and front desk. Upon arriving on our first night, we requested to be moved to a different room, as we were facing a parking garage, so there wasn't much natural light coming into the room. Furthermore, anytime a car alarm went off in the middle of the night, you could hear it (pleasant?). The hotel was booked with a wedding, so we weren't moved until the following morning. We went out for breakfast, and when we returned, all our belongings had been moved for us into a different room facing the street (which was MUCH better). The beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom nicely decorated (updated) and CLEAN. The concierge was also great, if he didn't know the answers to our inquiries, he either phoned an alternative to find out or searched for the information on the internet as we waited. The gym facility was also impressive - probably one of the most expansive as far as hotel fitness rooms go. There were multiple cardio machines, all equiped with t.v. screens/ music, weight machines, and free weights as well as a small area to stretch. The two things we did not like about the hotel was the expensive parking fee charged per night - $35.00, and the rate for outgoing calls. We ended up moving our car out from the lot the second night at 6:00pm and leaving it overnight just across the street from our hotel, on the street (for it's free on Saturday evenings, and Sunday). Overall, it was a positive experience staying at the W, and we would stay there again.Great stay, glad we picked this local after researching several. Best hotel pick I've been at yet.I generally enjoy staying at most W Hotels, but this isn't the case with the Seattle location. The hallways are extremely dark and the rooms need additional lighting fixtures. The rooms have very little noise insulation and you can hear everything. I could even hear my neighbors cell phone vibrating on their bathroom countertop. 
Great location, free internet in the lobby, pleasant staff, but I think there are more comfortable places in Seattle.My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights and can honestly say this is the best hotel we've ever stayed at. I've stayed at many hotels for business, but this by far is the best. We checked in at 12AM and were greeted by the friendly staff. At that hour, I appreciate the darkness inside the hotel. I would rather be greeted by candle light and low lighting than fluorescent-in-your-face lights. Anyhow, after we finally settled in at 2am, we ordered food from room service. I don't remember the name of the associate that helped us, but he was very friendly. He gave us everything that we asked for (again, at 2 AM in the morning): contact solution, dinner, two glasses of water (because we didn't want to open the $5 water), extra pillows, and toothpaste. I've never been anywhere that has been so accomodating at such a late hour. 
The beds are AMAZING!! I did not want to get out of bed because it was so comfortable. Now that I think about it, I still have to call the hotel back because I want to replicate the bed in my own home...I'm really not kidding, I'm looking for the hotel's phone number as I'm writing this. We even liked the couch. It was nice to wake up in the morning, open our blinds, lounge on the couch, and sip on our coffee (which the hotel serves for free until 10am in the lobby or you can go the Starbucks across the street). 
The hotel is only a short walk to Pike's Place Market. I walked here every morning to buy fresh fruit, bread, and jam for breakfast and prosciutto and cheese for lunch. It was a nice walk, but remember to bring your umbrella! The hotel is not too far away from Queen Anne, which has a lot of cool bars. We posted up at TS McHugh's for happy hour and to watch the Giants game. They had $2.50 drinks and $3 apps. Once the game was over we walked to this delicious Thai restaurant named ""Phuckit"". The food was so awesome and your get 15% off your dinner if you pay in cash!
Back to the Hotel review: The Acura experience was easy enough. I didn't have any problems booking a ride during checkout and they still were able to accomodated us when we were 20 minutes late for our reservation.
All in all, we feel like we got a steal! We booked our reservation through ""Name your Price"" on priceline. I can't wait to visit again!We stayed here before & after a cruise to Alaska. We had a TON of luggage and the front lobby guys were great about helping us - even when the cab left us off in the wrong place and he had to push a cart full of bags half way UP the hill/block. The concierge helped with a map and some additional recommendations, we were able to use the free Acura ride service to get to the cruise port and hung out in the ""living room"" with friends. The location was very convenient - but quiet at night - always felt safe though. Restaurant was good for breakfast and waiter was nice enough to steer us away towards the better items on the menu. Nice to get a real answer from him and not just ""oh everything is great here"". Room service breakfast was a little hit and miss - one was great - one was OK. For the price - I want great. Room needs a 2nd chair for in room diningEven though amenities were limited, enjoyed our stay. Bed was excellent.The hotel is very good, perhaps not as huber cool as some of the newer W hotels.
It is nonetheless very nice, the room is large, with a nice bathroom.
Service is good and I found it exceptional good value for money. However I booked it though an expedia package.
I would stay again!I have to agree on the Fiji five-dollar water. I was thirsty, ready to drink it thinking it was free, and it said five bucks on it! Now, come on, wouldn't that be a nice gesture to greet a guest after they've checked in! Now, there is water in the lobby laced with cucumbers and such during the day, and free coffee in the morning, but they don't tell you about it when you check in. The valet guys are sooo funny! Also, the bar could use some help as far as attitude and service. I didn't mind it being dark. I mean, we women over the age of.....don't mind the darkness! Oh, you have to go to the Palomino for happy hour. It starts at three and goes all night. It's on 5th and Union, I believe in the City Centre up the escalator. YUMMY! And the price was so right. They have flatbread pizzas and regular thin crust pizzas for six and eigh bucks. Then, we ordered a side of meatballs that were so delicious and put them on the pizza. I want to return just to go to that place! Can't beat the price.
Oh, yes, the W....internet is not free, but we enjoyed the lobby to go on the computer. It was a business trip for my husband and I tagged along, so the parking was reimbursed but it would bother me if I had to pay out of pocket. Yes, very expensive to park anywhere in Seattle. 
I hated that bedspread. It was so thick! I had to take it off the bed. Who ordrers these things? Overall, I liked the place and would stay there again. The gym is very nice, but two of the treadmills wouldn't turn on when it said to touch the screen.Trendy lobby with noisy bar. Try the Lemon Drop in the bar, but beware of slow service. Well-equipped, fairly large rooms. Nice, flat-screen tv. Internet speed barely decent. Nice bed and quiet rooms makes for good sleep.As funky & hip as the Seattle W is...it is NOT worth the money. I booked a room online & requested a king size bed in my reservation. When I got to my room I was given 2 queen size beds. Side note - unless queen size beds in the US are smaller, which I doubt, I would consider these beds double beds at best. When I called down to the front desk to voice my concerns & see if I could get a room as per my booking request, I was curtly told that there were no other rooms available, that I wasn't the only person who was not getting the King Size bed as requested, and that there was nothing he could do. No solutions, options or compensation offered for my dissatisfaction. 10 minutes after checking in to the Hotel, my key card wasn't working in the elevator. When i went to the front desk to get a new card, I observed the same front desk clerk issuing complimentary drinks at the hotel lounge to a few guests who were looking for something to do. REALLY - you're going to offer complimentary drinks to people who are bored but to your guests who are unsatisfied, nothing? I was given a new key card but each time I went in the elevator is took about 5-6 times before it actually worked & let me up the elevator (frustrating & embarrassing). The hotel building itself has incredibly bad insulation/sound proofing & I could hear my neighbours at all hours of the night & day. The room doors weren't properly aligned (or something) & extremely hard to close - you basically had to slam the door to close it. So again, loud noises as everyone around me was slamming their doors. And the final complaint - $15 for internet access? For the nightly rate @ the W, internet should be free! If the Holiday Inn can afford free internet, I'm sure the W can afford it! Overall, extremely poor customer service & loud...not worth the money!Came to Seattle with my husband for a business trip. I was excited about my stay at the famous ""W"" hotel but once we got here, I was a little let down. As others wrote, internet in the room is $15/day! ""W""hat's UP with that?!?!? I traveled 6.5 weeks in the summer all over Canada and US and never ONCE paid for wifi! So this was disappointing to say the least. There is FREE wifi in the LOBBY (where I am now writing this review from) so I guess that's something.
In the lobby (on Wednesday night, no less!) there was a huge disco type scene - very loud music, lots of people milling about. Too much I think. I guess there's a bar in the lobby. I actually couldn't tell cause it was soo dark, lights turned down and dark furniture and furnishings make for not being able to actually SEE what is there!
The rooms are very nicely appointed but the covering on the bed is way too bulky and the room gets quite warm in the night (like the AC just clicks off after a certain time?!?).... so I called down and asked for a simple blanket. The one brought up was too small for our king bed so I had to call down to ask for another one. The bathroom is huge and very well lit - so if you need to actually see anything, you have to go into the bathroom. Huge tub, nice counter space, thick towels. Robe in closet, nice. No stand for luggage - again ""W""hat's up with that?!?! There is a safe in the closet. Fridge is mini-bar style with extremely overpriced stuff in it. A small bottle of Fiji water on the bedside had a $5 tag on it. There is a bucket for ice and glasses for wine and a wine bottle opener. There is a DVD player and movies I understand you can get for a fee - I didn't check the price cause I was sure it was too much.
The sound on the wall-mounted flat screen HDTV is limited and with the hum of the AC it makes certain programs hard to hear. The lighting in the room is horrible - it's supposed to make it all ""atmospheric"" but for middle aged people, as our vision starts to deteriorate, we need MORE light!! MORE LIGHT!!!! This is actually a common theme in a lot of hotels and a big bone of contention for me when traveling - but it was even darker here at the W.
They are very kind and courteous to your every question or request. When you call the operator or front desk (or the ""W""hatever/""W""henever line) they answer the phone with your name. Super duper service! 
The concierge is fabulous! Travis was particularly wonderful! The lobby has candles at the front desk check in. Dark wood and dark counter adds to the overall DARKNESS of the hotel.
Parking for $44/valet per night is totally ridiculous. There is a lot next door for $30/nt I think. We didn't know about it til it was too late. 
You do need a room key to go up to the guest rooms which adds to security especially for single women traveling alone. 
But overall the W is highly overrated. I wish I could have given it a better review but most of the things that other people have written in their reviews were true and makes it not great for the price. 
I think the W is going for a different look with all the dark wood, candles, darkness in the rooms, loud music in the lobby.... but it does not inspire in me the desire to come back here any time soon. Perhaps the younger crowd loves it all. The older generation needs MORE LIGHT!
For the money, stay somewhere else. The Crowne Plaza is supposed to be very nice. And even the Westin. 
Claire of the 'Couve
Vancouver, WA, USAFor the price, the W Hotel offers very little to bring me back here. The daily parking rate of $37/day and $15/day for internet - no coffee or tea in the room, no turn down service - what's to make this a ""luxury hotel""? There are many other hotels in this price range that offer so much more! The prime location isn't enough when I feel I'm being ""nickeled and dimed"" while staying here. There are better hotels in the area that offer much more - keep looking and skip the W!We stayed at the W Seattle for four nights from 9/8-9/13 and it’s safe to say that our stay was anything but memorable. The W hotel is a nice hotel and the rooms are of adequate size with nice appointments, but everything else is average at best.
Things I would expect from a true luxury hotel: free internet (not just in the lobby); free coffee in room; free bottle of water in room. The W Seattle doesn’t have any of these.
The “Acura Experience,” what is supposed to be a kind of personal shuttle that can take you to anywhere within a few miles of the hotel only runs until 5 or 6 pm. To us, the only helpful time to use this amenity would be for going to dinner somewhere. Unless you were eating with seniors for the early bird special, it was done operating by the time you were ready.
The location of the hotel is wonderful, but there are many other hotels within the downtown area that my be a better overall place to stay.
The concierge was helpful for things around the city, mostly restaurants, but when we asked him a question about our Mt. Rainier trip that we were planning, he said he didn’t have any idea. I know the park and mountain isn’t within the city limits, but an attraction of that size with such proximity to the city is something a hotel concierge should know about and be able to inform its guests. Also, when we asked him what there was to do in a particular neighborhood, most of the time the only advice he could provide us with was a place to eat; which is not what we were looking for.
In my opinion, you can get the same comfort and quality for less at a place like the Westin or the Four Points Sheraton, or pay a little bit more each night and stay at a true luxury hotel like the Fairmont. At the W, all you are paying for is the name and unfortunately, it isn’t worth it. This hotel was not ranked that well amongst the Seattle hotels on the Trip Advisor list when we were booking it, but I went against the reviews and ratings and booked it anyways. BIG MISTAKE. Always trust Trip Advisor and rankings, especially a hotel such as this which has many, many reviews.
This was our first stay at a W hotel and I don’t think we will be returning to this W or any other anytime soon.We spent two nights at the W recently en route to our Alaskan cruise. What a place and what people! Perfect. Very helpful. My wife is in a wheel chair. The people at the W helped her so much. Brian, the Guest Services Manager, is the best. More attentive, helpful and personable than any. The Acura program is very nice as well. Highly recommended.It is an OK hotel to stay for a night or two but not very boutique, not that ‘luxury’ and certainly not very ‘WOW’ as per the W Hotels' mantra of self-gratification. 
Check in (about 10 pm) was the most underwhelming experience. Not friendly, not informative (no mention of the hotel restaurant, breakfast or gym) – just a rushed credit card - room card exchange transaction. No help with the bags. 
No tea/coffee facilities in the room: expected a nice espresso machine (not much to ask for in a ‘WOW’ hotel, is it?) but not even a kettle. Internet is 15 USD for 24 hours. 
Toiletries were not replenished on one of the nights. Bathroom towels were all of slightly different degree of wear and fluffiness so one gets three shades of white in a bale: from white-white to white-gray. 
Room was spacious but not sound insulated: could hear furniture opening/closing noises from the room next door and the noise of hotel elevators going up and down. 
I would not stay at this property again.The W must be a big Priceline seller - we obtained this hotel for $150 on a Saturday night. It was in a great location for walking to Pike Street market & shopping. A few hills, but good for you anyhow. 
We had read about not parking at the hotel which charges $45/night. We parked right next store at ACE parking for $30/24 hours (in and out). Luckily we did because when we arrived at the W hotel we noticed the lot was full - funny that they don't treat their customers better than that.
I read that the halls were very dark prior to arriving - and much to my suprize they were much darker than anticipated - so were the rooms. Not sure what that is all about, it is not sexy nor romantic, just dark. The rooms were nice with an industrial feel. All that you needed. A nice bathroom, robe (1), closet space with safe, fridge (which you had to empty out to put in your own stuff) and wine glasses. Oh, and the usual, ridiculous $5 bottle of 500 ml water worth .65 cents at a grocery store. Don't look out the window unless you want too what type of car is parked in the mile high parking lot beside you.
Normally beds bother me (either too hard or too soft), and just like baby bear, this was just perfect.
The lobby has free wifi (not in the room) and coffee in the morning. The bar although not really exciting made good drinks. 
The W Seattle was a good experience for a very decent price. I would go again - if I got the deal.Used Priceline and got the W. Check in was easy. Got to our hotel room and looked out the window and we faced a wall. Oh well. Room was nice. The location was perfect. We walked (with a stroller) from the W to Pikes place then to Space needle then to Fremont. We walked all over. We enjoyed the duck tour it was cheesy and fun. I would recomend this hotel if you use priceline I got it for 149. I wouldn't pay more.Stayed here recently for just one night. Arrived very early and was shown my room immediately; no need to stow my bags for 4 hours and come back hoping to get into my room. In by noon, and much appreciated.
It is a boutique hotel that likes to keep the hallways pretty dark. That is o.k with me, but I could see it being a bit uncomfortable for some. 
Anyway, room was a great corner room, bath amenities were great, work station very spacious.
One gripe, and this is it. $14.95 for internet. There is an equally lovely boutique hotel across the street that serves up free internet. Heck, there are coffee shops on the same street that have free internet. $14.95 just seems to me like a little bit of gouging. 
Other than the sticker shock of the internet, it was a terrific stay; everyone I dealt with courteous and helpful. 
I would stay again.The hotel is nicely decorated and very clean, and has a welcoming atmosphere. It's ideally located to visit Seattle, right there downtown, a 5 min walk to the waterfront. The only criticism I have is the very slow service during breakfast. For a simple continental breakfast at about 30% of the tables occupied we waited for over 20 min. This is IMO not acceptable for a hotel of this standard.Overdue review. We booked hotel via bidding process on Priceline to try feature. The hotel attempts to be modern but the room and bathroom were aged and overall a very average establishment. On site amenities are minimal. The parking was atrocious as we paid for valet parking each day and on second night we were told the lot was full when we arrived back from day out at 8 pm. We were directed to park at nearby parking garage then required follow up to remove billing for valet parking.....upon checking out we had to take all luggage up road to parking garage. Hotel should know a space is reserved for a room occupant but were more interested in accomodating pub patrons....probably a higher turnover and better tipping option. Anyhow, we will not stay at thishotel again and possibly avoid whole chain.My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sheraton for 2 nights before moving to the W Hotel for 1 night. We found the Sheraton to be a nice property with good service but the W Hotel was awesome! I wish we could have stayed longer. It is a trendy boutique style hotel with a good location. It was after dark when we arrived to check in; the entire lobby was lit dimly with candlelight. After we checked in we headed up to our room which we found to be modern but comfortable. I especially loved the love seat built in under the window; it was a cozy touch that reminded me of home. After settling in and changing we headed downstairs to find that a dj had setup in the main lobby area and the place had transformed into a popular cocktail spot. We also took a peak at the restaurant which looked really nice.
My boyfriend and I both work at hotels back home and can be picky but we both really liked this hotel. I would especially suggest it for young couples who enjoy dressing up for a nice evening of cocktails and meeting new people.My family and I are just back from a wonderful 2 night stay at this hotel and we had a fantastic time, so much so i am posting my first ever internet message. W you not only spoiled us above and beyond inadvertently you have moved me into the 21st century as well . The staff are very helpfull especially Brian Bunich who could not do enough for us . Working mums have a hard enough time so seeing my wife being spoiled in the very chic surrounds of the W made our short break all the more special .
Guys you get it right keep up the good work , thanks so much we will be back i can assure you , Working Mums go on treat your self's you deserve it .We stayed at the W in downtown Seattle on 8/14-817. Our family had 3 rooms there. The hotel is dim, but what do you expect it's a W hotel. We got a decent deal on Priceline. The rooms were nice and clean. The location is also great, there is a big Starbucks right across the street (though there was coffee in the lobby every morning) and also restaurants only a block away. They have Bliss products which are great. We didn't park at the W (it's $37). The parking garage next door was $30 with in and out privileges. The concierge was really helpful and so nice. I believe his name is Travis. He was really nice and helpful. Gave us excellent recs for oysters and a park to see a Frasier view of Seattle! The only problem I had was with the blinds. I love hotel curtains which block out the morning sun.The hotel is central located on intersection of Seneca and 4th ave. The light rail to airport is on street down. Taxi to airport costs $32, but there is no point of taking taxi with the stop so close to hotel. 
The hotel has a modern deco and young clientele. We stayed for the Friday night, the lobby was full of people chatting and drinking. One thing we did find peculiar is that the hallway is dimly lighted and well air conditioned to the point it felt chilly for a summer day The internet was free at lobby but will cost $15 in the room.. 
The room was large compared to some of other hotels we stayed in Seattle. The room we stayed had a large king bed and sofa by window. The room was clean and looked spacious.
The people at front desk was friendly and helpful. We had a early morning flight and asked for wake up call at 3:30 am. We had a personal call in the morning at the exact time. Some hotel has automated system for such calls, a personal call makes it specially nice.
There are a number of good dinning options near the hotel. Downtown Seattle is also full of coffee shops. We went to the pier, which is not far away, and enjoyed the beer and some seafood.
Overall, we liked the service, the room and the location.We spent a Thursday night in Seattle and have always been a fan of Starwood Hotels. The W in Seattle is in a perfect location, it's within walking distance to Pike Street and the Piers. I traveled with my husband (who's never been to Seattle) as well as my parents and auntie. They too loved the hotel and didn't mind the walk. My mother is very picky about hotels and she was very satisfied. The rooms were clean, concierge was helpful, service and valet were quick. It's true that the lighting is dark (per other reviews) but I like that type of ambience. It was a bit busy at night (bar and hotel desk) but was fine otherwise. I know we only stayed one night but we were debating on staying another. I highly recommend the W.If you appreciate a first rate experience you can't go wrong. Fantastic room with a great Seattle view, nice gym, Late night room service was quick, polite and very tasty. Enjoyed the complimentary fruit water in the lobby after a long day, the fireplace as well as a nice Columbia valley cab later in the night. Used priceline for an excellent rate.,!!
Have been to the westin and others in the past, if you want to treat yourself to something special you can't do better, Starbucks is right across the streetOur experience started off with a room that smelled like dog poop. The way the wanted to fix it was with air freshener. Called for room service several times, made calls every time 45min - hour later to check if they were still coming. Not a good experience with service. Hotel location is great and if you are coming for a wedding, the coordinator and staff are wonderful. Nice hotel but very over-rated...We stayed here for a week and got the room through Priceline's name your price at a pretty decent rate. While I did not particularly care for the trendy look of the common areas (when we arrived at night the lobby was really dark) and the service was only barely friendly, the location is fantastic - a 10 minute walk to the market and a block away from the light rail stop. Our room was quite roomy and comfortable although the view was a bit ugly - not unexpected at our bargain rate. Overall I was happy with this hotel, but not overwhelmed. I would consider staying here again.This hotel has everything, a perfect location in the heart of Seattle, fantastic rooms, great views and very good service.
The atmosphere of this property is very special with chill out music on the floors and a very cool and stylish interior.
If you stay there, check out lounge and have a few cocktails!
The only downsite I've recognized are the high parking costs.My wife and I enjoyed a 3 night escape to Seattle last month and had an opportunity to try the W. We've stayed at almost all of the major hotels (and some great B&B's) in Seattle and we looked forward to trying the W. As a loyal TA user we had read the wide range of reviews and were keeping our fingers crossed. We were not unhappy :)
To begin with the staff were all very keen to please. They were incredible especially the concierge (Jay?) My one suggestion for all of Seattle's concierge is to ""Get outta the box"" and try some local restaurants outside of downtown. Seattle has an amazing culinary scene but it's not all downtown.
The hotel location is fabulous and as long as you like the ""COOL' style they are going for you will like it. Dark hallways took some getting used to and I never did feel quite ""Mod"" enough but I wasn't uncomfortable. They offer towncar service but not at night(?), There aren't any coffee makers in the rooms but there are urns of Starbucks in the lobby in the AM and urns of lemon water in the afternoon.
Our King room (1911?) was comfy although it smelled a lil stale on check in. The housekeepers either need more time or a kick in the butt as there was a lot of dust (look at the wine bottles) and the grout in the shower/tub could use a good bleaching. I'd suggest that the housekeepers lie down in the tub and see what it looks like under the taps. Don't get me wrong its not really dirty its just not top notch. Towels and Robe (why just 1?) were really nice and the bed and bedding were fabulous. The drapes are not black out.
I liked the touch of having a DVD player in the room but ours was flaky. Maintenance was fast to respond to this issue when called. I also liked the window seat.
Parking is the same nasty thing here as every hotel in Seattle. $37 a night. Why? We parked right next door at the parking lot for $25 a day (still a lot!)
All in all we certainly had a nice enough stay with incredible staff (wonderful concierge), a comfy room and a can't be beat location. We would happily return .For such an expensive hotel it fell short- business center was tiny And internet not free!!! 10 dollars to fax - way over priced
Not impressedI stayed at the W in Seattle on my way to a business engagement and I couldn't have made a better choice. I have travelled extensively for both business and pleasure, but have never had a better or more luxurious experience than that of the W. The room had a fantastic view of the city and Puget Sound, and it was blissfully quiet. The bed was so comfortable and both my travelling companion and I wanted to go shopping for one just like it for home. We ordered room service (a very reasonably priced menu, considering) and the food was a great selection of Northwest delecacies. The menu also included more traditional fare, which my travelling companion appreciated. We highly recommend the sexy fries! The hotel staff was unbelievably gracious and unobtrusive. I want to give a special shout out to the guest services manager Brian Bunich. Brian was attentive and anticipated our every need. We definitely felt as if we were a guest in his home, and quite frankly we never wanted to leave.
The W hotel is a one-in-a-lifetime experience that I cannot recommend highly enough. It's pricey, but no more so than any other hotel of it's calibur. But considering what you get for your buck, it's a bargain. Stay at the W!I won't ever stay at a W hotel again. Not even for free! The place is a downer. Dark hallways, dark carpet, subdued lighting, dull rooms. If I wanted to stay in a funeral home I would just die. Across the street is a nice hotel for about the same price as the W. (The Olympic) The staff is nice, but they can't make up for the ""dead zone"" décor. 
Maybe the Goth crowd will keep this hotel alive; or maybe the vampires will find it a peaceful place to camp out when the sun is shining.Anthony checked us in -- very friendly, helpful, and thorough -- took care of us so we could be on our way. Our room was quiet, spacious, and full of wonderful amenities -- Bliss Spa products, super soft towels and robe, and super comfy bedding -- exceeded our expectations and experience. The W was a real treat at the end of a long day of travel!
Other pluses ... The W is just a short walk from the waterfront (ferries, restaurants, aquarium) and Pike Place. The hotel also teamed up with Acura to provide complimentary rides to nearby spots -- check out the new MDX (without the pressure!) and get a nice ride too!
We'd stay here again. There was just one minus -- the fan on the A/C seemed to be on all night -- not sure if the thermostat was malfunctioning or if we just missed a setting.Some things were very nice-some horrible. I think the valet doing a walk around to mark all the dents and scratches on your vehicle so that you don't accuse them of damage to the car should happen after they have assisted you with your bags-not instead of helping. Check in was quick. We were upgraded to a higher floor-gratis. The room was comfortable and clean. Then we went to the restaurant-during brunch hours. The menu was very limited-and horribly overpriced. I ordered the chefs special. $14 for 3 small pancakes. They were not cooked! My husband ordered a basic sausage, egg, potatoes-which I believe was $18. The potatoes and toast were black. The waitress never returned to the table to check on us. When she did finally come back we told her of our displeasure and they took off one meal. We would NOT recommend this restaurant. The hotel has a great location. Parking is now $44 per night. I did get a great rate for the hotel. We would stay again-but eat elsewhere.I like W hotels and my wife LOVES W hotels. This is a great place. Perfect location - right in the heart of downtown. About a block away is a fantastic sushi place (just walk straight down towards the water). 
Like most W's - everything is overpriced. The lobbies are like a chill nightclub but the drinks are like week and way overpriced. 
Our room was awesome - right on the corner about 20 floors up. Wrap around windows. The bedding, bath products and room service are all great (late night snack suggestions - get their fries and the milk and cookies).Stayed here 1 night for business. Typical, hip W hotel vibe in lobby and in rooms. As a Starwood Platinum member, I was upgraded to a suite which had a huge living room area and large jacuzzi tub in the bathtub among other extras. Always nice when a hotel goes the extra mile for loyal guests! Location is great for downtown business trips. Would recommend this place for a young couple or group of friends, but not necessarily families.I stayed 4 nights at The W Seattle and enjoyed what I consider to be one of Seattle's best hotels. The staff was unbelievable, the beds are the best, and the restaurant is off the hook. One of the best locations in the city as well.The hotel is cool and swanky. The staff is very nice and attentive. The bar downstairs has a good happy hour and on Weds have happy hour from 7 - midnight. 
The fitness center is adequate but cramped (after work), it's also dark (low lighting) everywhere - including the rooms.
A couple tips: Happy Hour at the Monanoco (across street) is good, get a pizza at Serious Pie (look it up) and DO NOT JAY WALK (seriously, it's a $85 ticket and they really ticket people).
Stay here if you get a good rate.Overall I had a great time at the W. The room we had was spacious, clean and comfortable. The people working here were nice and the drinks at the bar were awesome. I didn't use the work out room, so I can't comment on it, but I do wish they had a pool. We went over to the Fairmont to use their pool (my parents stayed there). 
The bed was slightly uncomfortable (a little too firm), but for the most part, we enjoyed our stay.My wife and I spent the evening of 5/29/10 at the W in Seattle to celebrate our anniversary. All I can say is that every aspect of our stay was top notch. The service the staff gave us was wonderful, espescially their concierge Jesse Lee. He went above and beyond to make our anniversary celebration wonderful. The bar and the resteraunt were both top notch. Great drinks in the bar as we spent a few hours there that evening and our waitress was awesome. We ate breakfast in the resteraunt Sunday morning and they actually made me something that was not on the menu! Excellent 
food and service. I don't want to leave out the room... We stayed in a fabulous corner room. Requested a higher floor and got floor 23. Great views!!! Even better bed an pillows. So flipping comfortable! I guess my only complaint is no coffee maker in the room. Starbucks 
is directly accross the street so all in all not the end of the world. Overall our experience was wonderful. It was our first stay but will not be our last. Thank you W!!!
Karl & Susan RueIt had been 2 years since I stayed at the W Seattle. It was my first W and still my favorite. I was concerned that the ""Hipper than Thou"" would grate on me. It didn't then and it doesn't now. The location is great for seeing Seattle or fo downtown business. If my business needs did not necessitate a car, I would have jumped the light rail from SeaTac and then had the Acura service take me around. I had to have a rental car and parking is an arm and a leg, but there is free street parking after 6 PM and all day Sunday. 
The bar is active with a nice mix of people and ages. They have a great happy hour early and then again late with a nice bar bites menu and drink specials. As a solo business traveler I ordered from the Restaurant Menu at the bar. The duck breast was outstanding and well priced.
The rooms are still great. Not huge, but very well designed and appointed. The bed is absolutely a dream. The bathroom very nicely done in Ivory tile and polished Chrome fittings. Finally the Bliss products are out of this world. 
A couple of nit pics. Room Service is fast and efficient, but EXTREMELY expensive. A Cheese swandwich is $17+22%+4.00 delivery.
I was very happy to find that my memories had not grown fonder with age, but htat it really was that nice a hotel.I actually prefer the W's location to the Four Seasons, the shops are nearer to get to. I also feel that I'm almost outgrowing the W's 'hip' style. There was a party (or after party) every night in the Lobby and the restaurant in the ground floor. The late night parties weren't much of a bother except running into drunk people in the Elevator.
True to W's style, the hallways are dimly lit, my companion even commented it might be because they were trying to save on lighting. 
The room itself were quite fine. We had a higher floor so no noise travelled up, and we weren't disturbed in anyway. The W also offers a free car service to places nearby with their Acura SUV service. 
The staff for the most part was polite. We checked in late at night and the concierge was helpful in directing us where to go for food, mostly to popular cafe style places. However, we ended up across the street at the Fairmont, they've got a brilliant restaurant, Shuckers.
Out of all the staff, there was probably just one single front desk person that was a bit dismissive when we wanted more info (We wanted to get a half day rate since we were going to check out late, I mean, c'mon, we're trying to pay more, so a little service please).
Overall, it was a standard stay, I'd recommend it to younger couples and to those that aren't bothered by late nigh social gatherings and occasional drunkard in the elevator (We were there for three nights, and ran into an inebriated person every night). 
Personally, I felt I was over the age limit of the W. I'm not sure if I'd stay there the next time, the Fairmont looks pretty inviting and is just right next door.We spent 2 nights and really enjoyed the hotel. Our only recommendation would be the addition of a small room fridge for keeping purchased liquor and items such as cheese from the local cheesery cool after opening. Other than that, the bed is incredible and the staff very attentive. Good value!Just want to say that this hotel is in a great location, very clean, great food , and awesome customer service. My friend and i had a close encounter of the technical counter of the technical kind during our stay( not our fault) and hotel staff were very prompt to look after it. I was very impressed with the service at this hotel and with its management team. All i can say is keep up the great service.My partner and I spent 4 fabulous nights at the W Seattle. Our suite offered spectacular views of the skyline and the Space Needle. The staff at the W was very accommodating and helpful with reservations and special requests. The W has a prime location in downtown and is a very convenient hop from SeaTac airport using the new Link mass transit train. It is a nice ride to the hotel. From there you can walk to Seattle's best attractions. The W Seattle is a Winner and we will certainly return...Congratulations! You’ve chosen the best hotel in Seattle! 
Over the years I have become spoiled with the service and amenities provided by W Hotels all over the world, but the W Seattle is at the top of my list. 
My Dad and I live just east in Coeur D’ Alene Idaho, so Seattle is a manageable drive giving us a great opportunity to relax, eat, drink and be merry. We’ve stayed at the W Seattle five times now from Christmas through the baseball season. I realized I have been remiss in not providing a review for other travelers, as well as to show our appreciation for the fine service we always receive at the W Seattle.
Initially, I contacted the W to inquire as to whether they were pet friendly and happily discovered that not only are they pet accepting but are pet LOVERS, a huge benefit as my Dad refuses to leave his small dog.
We arrived at the W, greeted straight away by the very friendly and helpful valet attendants who whisked our bags into the hotel. The Valets gave incredible service, bountiful information and greeted us by name the whole weekend. They do charge for parking but having lived in metropolitan cities for many years this doesn’t make me flinch. They do offer quick and courteous unlimited entry and exit, which many hotels do not.
Check-in in the chic and modern lobby, complete with smooth music and original art, was flawless and efficient. The staff’s friendliness and professionalism continued with our front desk attendant Mary who checked us in and also provided much valuable information. 
Tasty, fruit infused, chilled water was offered in the reception area of which we gladly accepted, being parched from our five hour drive.
The lobby and lower “Living Room” have a very cool jazz/Ibiza Lounge feel, coated with hip accents. At night Living Room turns into the place to see and be seen as the bar is just to the left, complete with a DJ spinning etherial music. The Living Room is also where I would take my morning cup of coffee and utilize the free wireless internet. I usually just pay for internet in the room but not wanting to disturb my pop who sleeps late these days, the Living Room is very comfortable and a good way to socialize with other early risers. Additionally, if you’re a Starbuck’s addict there’s a location directly across the street from the Living Room.
Our room was incredible. Upon entering we discovered another amazing W touch of class with the doggy bed, complete with personal food and water bowls and a name placard with “Lilly” written on it. I believe there was even a toy of some sort for her. 
Both beds with incredible linens and comfort kept us sleeping like babies.
To the far end of the room was a great window couch affording an incredible view of the Seattle skyline and an amazing place to sit and read, as well as enjoy our 4:30 cocktails before the ball game.
The bathroom continued the flow of comfort and sophistication complete with Bliss Spa soaps, shampoo and lotion. I loved the Bliss products so much I’m ordering them for home.
The W Seattle is located perfectly just up and away from the hustle and bustle of Pike Market but close enough to walk. Shopping, dinning, museums, live entertainment, bars, and the waterfront are all easily accessible from the W. Because of my dad’s age and replaced knees we usually walk DOWN and take a cab back from wherever we’ve gone. A cab ride from the W too all the cool spots is $5 - $15, roughly.
We’ve eaten in Earth and Ocean, the in house dining option, on several occasions and have never been disappointed. The fare is good, the service friendly and attentive and price point is reasonable for a hotel restaurant. I will say I prefer breakfast there, great omelets and incredible seasoned new potatoes. In all fairness I must say that as a bit of a foodie I find it difficult to dine anywhere more than once, this is certainly true of hotel restaurants as well. So our not eating at Earth and Ocean every evening is more from my need to explore and discover new dining spots.
Bottom line, the W Seattle is excellent, and we anxiously look forward to returning at every departure. I can’t say that for too many things in life, especially hotels.
So, book the room, enjoy the city and look for Mike and Ron, “The Bacon Boys” sitting in the Living Room or the bar and join us for a cocktail.I've stayed at many Starwood hotels and this one is truly one of the best. I found no flaw whatsoever. Everything was better than expected. The valet was especially prompt. Bar and room service were some of the best I've experienced. Room was large and spotless; perhaps the best bed I've ever slept in. Not sure why W Hotels can be so inconsistent, but this place has it's act together.My wife and I spent a long weekend at the W hotel in Seattle this last week. The hotel certainly lives up to it's reputation in the world of travels! The staff and the concierge, Andrew Franks, did an outstanding job of making sure our trip was one of the great ones of all our travels!
The hotel ranks right up there with the best of the best, and that is saying a lot for a guy that has been all over North America as a pro pilot!!
Everything we requested for on the trip was taken care of by the staff and Andrew Franks. Nothing is left to chance by the hotel and the management and staff and it shows in the complete package of a well managed and smooth operation.
Once again, thanks for a fun long weekend and support for all our needs for the trip to and from the Seattle area!!!!We were eager to stay at the W Seattle, without kids this time. We were not disappointed. The staff and concierge were extremely helpful in suggesting restaurants and making reservations. After a long week on the road for business it was quite a treat to end our week in Seattle at the W. Very relaxing and refresing...even with the city construction below.Loved this hotel and the staff.
We checked in to this hotel late at night and were very impressed with it from the beginning, the valets were efficient and courteous, the front desk staff was friendly and even surprised us with giving us a choice of rooms. We picked one and then once we saw it decided that we might prefer the other option and when we went down to the desk to ask to move they were quick to help us switch rooms. 
The room was nice and modern with comfortable beds and couch to hang out on. Housekeeping seemed great/no complaints. They offer free refreshments in the lobby… interesting drinks and fresh apples. We used the busness center and appreciated their help. The bar was great but very busy so it was hard to get a seat but worth the wait. The hotel is in a great location but it was the staff that made it special and we’d stay here again. (Maybe this W can give the W in Times Square some tips!)Nice hotel, great trendy rooms, good food! Visit the market in Seattle it's lovely!my husband and i stayed 2 nights at the W seattle for a weekend getaway. the 'cool' - i mean this both positively and negatively- 'cold' could also be used, receptionist checked us in efficiently. he placed us in a nicer room than i had booked which was very kind and appreciated. we had a corner room with floor to ceiling windows- spectacular view of the city. 
the 'bliss' shower/bath products were nice. but charge me to use the robe? that's kinda weird for a very upscale hotel? the tub was small, but clean.
the BED was the highlight. sooooo comfy, great linens, couldn't have had a better nights sleep. 
the bar downstairs was good- busy, so we sat at the comfy chairs to order. this was fine, but kindof difficult to eat the hors de vours. (the kobe burger was fabulous) 
i would stay again if i got a good deal! and of course, parking fees are crazy expensive!!!This is my favorite W Hotel. The staff is super friendly, and always remembered my name and said hello when I arrived. The beds were great too.Clean, serviceable, no major deficiencies. But dim ""mood"" lighting everywhere that made us all squint to get through lobby; room design is full of ""little extras"" that feel like a marketing consultant designed them (custom CD, ""boutique"" snack foods for in-room purchase, branding the concierge/front desk as the ""whenever whatever"" phone line, etc.), but it all doesn't add up to the understated, unobtrusive quality of good business hotels in Europe or major US cities, including those in the same price range or cheaper. 
My room looked out on ... the inside of a concrete parking garage about 10 feet away, where commuters looked into my bedroom as they got out of their cars, unless I kept the blinds closed. The heat/ AC system was pretty loud unless I kept it turned off altogether.
Location is handy walking distance to Pikes Market and downtown restaurants/shopping. The Belle Epicurean, half a block away on 4th, has outstanding French pastries and coffee.
I think you may be able to do as well or better with other downtown hotels for a little less money.I've stayed here many times since it opened but not in the past three or four years. I swear the same fingerprints are on the furniture in the public areas and I'm not sure if the carpeting in the bedroom has been vacuumed. Yes occoupancy is down and the economy is hurting but this place is only about a 3-star. Oh and did I mention it smells?I stay at W hotels all of the time, this is my second stay at the Seattle W, and it's decent. Nothing out of the ordinary, exactly what you would expect from a W. The bed and linens were SUPERBLY soft and comfortable.
And I, of course, love the Bliss amenities.
Here's the ""but""....I love the Soapy Sap (shower gel). I use a ton of it. I shower several times a day. Who cares? I'm on vacation, I want lots of towels and lots of shower gel. When I called to ask some more, on my last morning there, the ""Whatever Whenever"" person told me there would be a CHARGE for extra amenities ""since you're checking out today.""
Really? You want to charge me for shower gel?
If somebody wants too much shower gel, just give it to them. It's a luxury hotel. Surely people have asked for more unreasonable things than excessive amounts of shower gel.
I was quite put-off by it, and because of that, I doubt I'll stay here again. As a Starwood loyal member, I may as well go to the cheaper Westin a few blocks away.
I would also note that their turn-down service is kind of useless...they come around in the afternoon, not long after they do regular housekeeping. If you are the kind of traveler who spends late afternoon in the room, getting ready for dinner and a night out, you won't get turn-down service, because they'll show up at like 5pm. Really, they should come in the evening when you're already out...like 8pm 9pm.
But I guess that's why this property is only considered a ""Level 4"" when most Ws are considered Level 5. $37/night parking, trying to avoid having nighttime housekeeping staff, and CHARGING PEOPLE FOR EXTRA SHOWER GEL = Cheap tightwads run the place.Conveniently located just walking distance to the downtown shopping area.
I think the only concern I had was the self-parking fees - too expensive. We managed to find a decent priced for $7/night over the weekend BUT when we left they attendant told us that starting the following week they will be increasing their fees up to $30/night. What a difference!! Anyways, that is downtown parking so unless you want to walk 5 blocks away then you'll be paying $25 and upwards/night.I was stuck in Seattle for three extra days due to the East Coast blizzard and found my home at the W. Many Ws make me feel about as cool as Homer Simpson, and yes, if you want to see people wearing black, you can find them here. That said, for an old guy on business I was at home at the W. Brian, the guest services manager, got me a great room at an outstanding price. My corner room was spacious, comfortable, and worked very well for me. Staff suggestions were good (Serious Pie being a good, reasonably priced pizza place a couple of blocks away, good suggestion). Great room, great view, comfortable bed, nice amenties. Extremely centrally located, convenient to everything downtown.I surprised my husband with a trip to see Seattle. The W is beauitful, we were checked in quickly and they had a birthday cake for my guy in the room. I was kinda of upset that I asked for a suite and they messed up my room so we ended up with a delux but no biggie. The concierge was helpful but not the best I have had. Room was nice, looks like any W we stayed at. The bar was fun but quiet, had a good late night scene since the tourist wuldnt venture to far at night. Shopping was a walk but the same stores I have in NYC. We did a lot of walking since the location isn't prime but we were okay with that because what better way to see a city. I liked Seattle and the outskirts but the people were very quiet and there were a lot of homeless kids there. I wouldnt go back but would go to Vancouver next time. Maybe just for a couple of days but move on.Very clean, modern, new (looks new anyway), and the service is excellent. The room service food is top notch as is what they store in the mini fridge. Thank you! The only complaint I have is the car they called me upon checking out. The driver had a hard time getting around, did not have a meter and did not know what to charge me?
They should provide their own transportation. It would suit them well.I’ve been to Seattle dozens of times, but had never stayed at the W. I’m usually in the Sheraton that is only a few blocks away, but I thought this time around I would try something different. We were checked into our room by an agent with minimal friendliness. Not very welcoming.
The rooms are classic W in décor and classic W by charging for everything! The bathroom had some mild mildew in the shower and the return air vents were pretty dusty, which turned me off a bit. Upon checkout I notified the agent (same guy) of the issue and he responded with – “Oh… Sorry”. 
Now for the good points. This property is in a great location; heart of downtown. Located only a few blocks from a light rail station and well within walking distance to restaurants and shopping. The bed is amazing – super comfortable with excellent pillows. This alone was worth the other inconveniences.
Overall, I would not recommend this property, rather, I would recommend their sister property, the Sheraton.We splurged by staying here and it was well worth the money! we had a room on one of top floors- the W really pays attention to the little details like stocking your hotel room with Bliss products. Staff was really friendly- a very trendy hotel. earth & ocean was a great dinner but quite pricey. all in all, a really cool place to stay in Seattle...you can walk everywhere, fantastic location! highly recommend!I booked 3 nights thru their website.
My request was a high floor & corner room.
Upon check in, I was given the non-corner room
on 16th floor. As soon as I took a elevator up to my room,
I noticed that I had to swipe room key to activate the elevator.
Also the wall is relatively thin, so you can hear the next door.
There was also a road construction on 4th ave, so the noise level
is very high and irritating. 
There was no coffee maker in the room and the bar serves coffee at $3.50.
You can buy coffee at starbucks cross the street but they close at 6pm.
The art hanging on hallway right next to my room displays dead person stuck in reservoir. What a wacky taste! The lighing is too dim too. I would never stay here again!
The hotel stuff ( front desk ) is not friendly & there is NO welcoming mood here.
I usually love W hotel but not in this particular one.
The entrance on 4th avenue is always people waiting for thier bus and 
there's a steps it's not suitable to bring heavy luggage thru this door.
however, if you go to Seneca St, you can go to front desk without go up the stairs.Awesome hotel, trendy decor, right downtown.
Have a great Acura partnership = free rides downtown where ever your going.
Only pitfall is the 40+ dollar parking at the hotel, which they don't tell you about.Our stay was over New Years Eve and we chose it for two reasons, we had always wanted to stay there and it was very close to where we wanted to have dinner that evening. Check in and the valet was quite nice, however to valet my car for 37.00 a night I thought was a bit much. 
We stayed on the 15th floor in a corner suite, the room it's self was nice, however the view was God aweful. We had a view of taller buildings and roof tops as well as 4th Ave, I think. The bathroom was poorly lit and to take a bath would have taken at least an hour to fill the tub--not kidding and I couldn't get the water to stay warm in the tub once it was in there. The bathroom was also a bit molding since it had no fan.
I would really think twice about staying there again.if you are allergic to pets, don't stay here. A four star hotel that allows pets??? Hmm. I didn't know that when I booked; I guess the dogs in the bar should have been my first clue. Location is great-better values for your $$. The hotel looks worn, service is extremely poor in the dining room and at the management level. the restaurant is terrible. What else do you need to know!! Oh, yes AND parking is $44 - yes a night.This was the first time I was staying at W brand and was not sure what I would get. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I reached there. The reception area was small but well decorated and it seemed there was party on when I checked in late at night. Later I learned it was the restaurant which comes to life after sunset. The rooms were very tastefully decorated and seemed ideal for romantic getaway (alas I was travelling on business there). The staff is very helpful and eager to fulfil your wish.We were celebrating our 9 year anniversary and stayed at the W for 2 nights. Room was fine - a bit smelly but it was an upper floor with no windows, so maybe musty stench is just what you get. 
Our BIG complaint. We were new to Seattle and took the consierge advice and let him book us a dinner reservation for Italian. We were dressed in jeans and sweatshirts but he must have thought we were Madonna and Guy Ritchie cause we booked us at a SUPER fancy place and we walked there, had to turn around and walk back. THANKFULLY, the car parking people redeemed our night by retrieving our car and sending us to Buca de Beppo - awesome, casual Italian food. Which is what we asked for in the first place at the consierge. The 2nd night, we had a different guy working for we asked for a mexican food option. We told the consierge about our previous night. We told him - casual mexican. He hailed us a cab and off we went. The cab driver couldn't find the place - cost us $20 cab fare and then he dropped us off at some wierd, freaky tequila bar in the middle of nowwhere. Not a mexican restaurant. Not a place for a young yuppie couple either. Thought we'd entered the Twilight Zone. Had to find a cab back. The parking people didn't know of any mexican places so we ended up and the nearby mall (since it was after 8) and ate there.
Ok, if you are the W, and are a prissy as you make your hotel to be - please note that not everyone staying there is as ""metropolitan"". When you see two people in jeans and gap sweatshirts asking for a dinner recommendation, don't send them to a black tie restaurant OR a gay tequila bar! Ruined our trip totally at night. I was super mad, but my hubby held me back from yelling at both men. 
I think the hotel needs to hire a few more quality workers AND a few front desk people who know how to smile - GEEZ, what a downer the front desk is! It's like they are so unhappy to see you.
The room is fine though....if that's all you're looking for Oh yeah, also $38 per day for parking!!!!Here are my reasons why I have chosen W several times before and still seriously consider it every time I travel to Seattle. 
Ambiance, rooms & restaurants: W Seattle has a boutique feel to it and you feel chic the moment you step inside. I am particularly fond of the lounge in the evening, when local or not, beautiful people come for drinks (and sometimes food). The rooms are fine, nothing extraordinary but definitely won't dissapoint. I don't have the same complaints as many others do about the dark hallways and elevators. It's nice in a way but I find the dimmed lighting more Vegas than luxe. It's a colour preference perhaps. The restaurant is expensive and the food subpar. I've only eaten brunch there and try not to do that if I don't have to. 
Service: Don't expect great service from the front desk, concierge, lounge servers or at the restaurant. Room service is also slow and so is housekeeping. The staff seem to have received no training in customer service.
Distance to shops: It's a bit of a walk but all downhill. If you want proximity to Nordstrom, Hyatt is your hotel but I prefer W and just walk 5 min. to Nordstrom. 
Overall: If your stay is a short one which wouldn't give rise to too many interactions with the hotel staff, then W is a great place to stay. It's definitely worth a try for you to form your own opinion.I travel on business to Seattle every week and stayed at the W for 2-3 days a week for the past 3 months. It is a great place with a great location and great service. The staff knows me by name and a very detail oriented.
I would suggest the restaurant downstairs. The place is always empty during the week nights and I never went there but on a recent night I was too tired to go outside and decided to get a quick bite. The lamb and cheese is great and service is second to none. Needless to say, I will be back.Visited family in Seattle that I hadn't seen for yrs. The hotel was the one chosen for my husband with his business travel. The beds were very comfortable, though the scenery for us wasn't the best, as we had the view of a parking garage. This sits only about four blocks from the Harbor, though walking there was hard for us, as the hills are so steep. We had a nice restaurant at the hotel, but they had blaring music at the bar next to it and so it wasn't the easiest place to relax in. The food was excellent, (prime rib), but the cost for the meals were a bit pricey. It was in the hub of all the best shopping places that you could find! They had numerous high designer shops all the way down to Ross for Less. They had a nice German Restaurant, called Gordon Biersch at a mall a few blocks away in a wonderful three or four story mall. Great taxi drivers in the area and all seemed hospitable and those in Seattle just seemed laid back and relaxed sort of folks. Would love to go back again. Only negative is the loud, blaring music in the bar, but if you like trendy music, then you would like that too. Saw the Seattle Space Needle, which is a must for Seattle travlers. Must have their lunch or dinner package when you are there, which is pricey, at about 100 dollars for two people, but the Space Needle rotates and you get a complete view of the Seattle horizon. One of the prettiest skylines at night that I have ever seen!!! Had to pay for internet use in room, but the package was about forty dollars for a few days. Great fish meals at the harbor! Argosy tours were great too, to see the Seattle area.I'd long been curious about the W's, never having stayed in one before, until now. It always seemed like it was more fun inside from the outside, I was wrong. Instead its a dark den of hype and you're better of staying elsewhere.
Front desk wasn't overly friendly, and not at all effective in dealing with 3AM noisy neighbours in an adjacent room. The walls in this hotel don't offer much of a sound barrier, we felt like we were IN the party next door.
When I later visited the front desk in person to again mention the all night party, I got lots of apologies but no action. Only after insisting that an apology wasn't good enough was I offered a free breakfast or a few dollars off the room... Good thing I didn't have to strong-arm them to remove the double-charged parking fee from my bill.
Pros: Nice location, decent bed, good restaurants in area (try Purple, it was great!)
Cons: Ineffective/indifferent staff, valet parking $40+/night, valet/parking entrance is a zoo, NOISY room, dirty room service carts were left in the hallways for hoursStayed here back in June of 2008 and really enjoyed it. Now it seems a bit weathered and not as clean as previous. Some of the towels were stained and the bathrobe in the bathroom also had a stain on it. Housekeeping just did not pay attention to details - for instance, one day there were three washcloths left on my suitcase. I believe they left them there by accident but it struck me as odd. Next day the bed wasn't totally made. Seems like they just left before they were totally finished cleaning the room. Not very impressive for a W. Will try the Westin next timeOur stay at the hotel was wonderful. The hotel was very chic, modern and minimalistic. Got a great price on priceline, however valet parking for the night was $40!! that was a shock the next morning! Other than that it was wonderful!We had the opportunity to stay at the W Seattle on a recent visit, and what a wonderful hotel it is! I was afraid that it would be too trendy for us (we're pretty laid back), but it was just beautiful and.....cool. Hip. The rooms were spotless (and I'm really picky about that), the bathroom was HUGE, and the location was quite good - go to the little French patisserie on the next block and have a ham-and-Gruyere croissant - to die for! The W is within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and the Westlake Center Mall (neat for people watching in the public square outside) . My only complaint was that the hallways were really dark (too much ""mood lighting"" that was pretty but not very functional). Highly recommended!From the excellent staff, who were without exception excellent, to the wonderful food at the bar, I was extremely impressed with the W Hotel.The rooms were updated, beautiful view of the space needle. Great location to walk anywhere downtown Seattle. Staff was very helpful when needed. We would stay again.This hotel is one of those places that makes you feel stylish just by being there. It is very styled, the way that most W Hotels are, but it still has a bit of the Seattle vibe. The location is great, esp. if you are there for business or high-end shopping. The in-house restaurant is pricey and has some weird hours, but the food is pretty good. The rooms were very comfortable and the Bliss products are a nice touch.Once again the W has outdone itself. From the blush products in the bathroom to the amazing bartender! We stayed in a corner suite facing the water. I like the corner rooms best because the windows wrap all around. The room and bathroom are very spacious. The bed was so comfortable! I didn't want to leave. Service throughout the hotel was purely excellent most notably the bartender who turned me on to my new favorite vodka. He also gave us excellent advise on nightlife spots to hit later that evening. The only complaint was the parking. It's a little tricky getting in the garage and the valet took awhile to get our car back. But really a perfect hotel to stay at while in Seattle.A great spot in the heart of the city. Well positioned for shopping, food and taking in the culture of the CityFirst W stay in the US. We loved W Seoul so thought other are equally good. As noted by many before W Seattle is more concentrated on getting people in for the bar, meetings etc. The lobby is confusing and no signs anywhere to find check in etc. The concierge was good and had a few tips, and I could borrow a brolly for the rain (it does rain every day in Seattle). 
At check in I was offered a better room as SPG gold. The room may have been on a high floor, but no noise isolaton. Any door that opened and closed in the hallway I could hear all night. Also room service trays etc were left in hallways 24 hours plus. Many staff passed by the trays, glasses etc but didnt touch it. I think this level of hotel all staff should take responsibility to keep it looking nice and clean and help each other. 
In the room there was no water boiler (I could borrow one though after asking), no coffee cups and no free water (there should be for SPG gold). Amenities are good though and refreshing (Bliss range). 
Downstairs bar was ok, they have a good happy hour 4-7 with a few bargains on the beers. They closed early as low volume of customers, a frequent problem in the US as staff work for tip and not for hourly pay it seems. A bit annoying for clients staying at the hotel. 
Overall location and hotel is good and if you get a good rate go for it, but if not perhaps consider the sheraton or westin.I enjoyed my stay at the W but it definitely has an ultra modern feeling, seemingly targeted at a younger crowd.
The location was great and we easily walked everywhere.
They offer a free limo service around town but the drawback is they end at 5:00 so we weren't able to utilize it.
Offered coffee and fruit in the lobby which was nice.
Was surprised that the labeling on the bathroom amenities (shampoo, conditioner, lotion etc) looked like it was from a Motel 6.
Doesn't have a pool, locker room or spa service.Location is great, staff were very friendly and helpful, our room was very nice. They do seem to like to keep everything very dimly lit. I get that everyone wants to discourage horrible cars from coming downtown, so the additional parking charge is just something to live with. But why oh why does a high-priced hotel still feel the need to rip me off for a bottle of water or wireless internet service? That just seems so cheap. And I do agree with one previous reviewer, the linens were not really outstanding and had that old-laundry smell. On the whole, I would recommend this hotel to friends but with warnings about the negatives.Our room was clean and very comfortable. The beds were extremely comfortable and the decor was fantastic. I really liked the wooden blinds and built-in window seat. I didn't want to leave the W Seattle!!
My only negative thing to say about this hotel is that the shower curtain seemed a little too big for the shower - it kept getting in the way. Other than that, our stay was perfect.Stayed at the W over my birthday weekend and chose it because a) I've always wanted to stay at a W and b) for it's location. Furnishing-wise, it's a beautiful hotel. Very modern and trendy. As others have stated, the hallways leading to the rooms are dark, much darker than I expected. In fact I had to pretty much get my nose up to the room number to see if it was the correct one!
The location is fantastic! There's great restaurants all around the area (we went to the Purple Cafe a block away and was NOT disappointed). The monorail to Seattle Center is about a 10ish minute walk, a brisk walker can do it quicker.
My pet peeve about the W is really about the staff. Pretty much everyone we encountered were not outright rude, but they all just seemed indifferent. Like they never really seemed to interact with the guests as I've encountered at other hotels. I can't compare my experience with other W's since this was my first stay, but I hope the other ones have a more upbeat and lively staff. The front desk staff seemed blah, the bartenders weren't very happy the way I'm used to bartenders being. Is it just Seattle and the gloomy weather? Or is it really that bad working at the W Seattle?
The bright spots were the valet parking attendants. They were always very friendly and happy and ready to help. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but when we went to look at the menu the hostess was very friendly and cheery. Nothing like the rest of the staff.
Anyway, the hotel is a decent place to stay if you don't care about staff interaction. But I'm not sure I'd stay at this location again.First let me say that my husband and I are 50 years of age, and the W should have a disclaimer that this hotel is not suited for anyone older than 40! When we walked into this property we thought that the hotel was experiencing a ""Power Outage"".. no lighting except for candles-- we were told that it created an ambience, and for which I agree. The problem is, that it is way too dark in the hallways and the common areas. There are steps leading to the lower lobby--steps that you can barely see. I can only imagine that one day, the ambience will be quickly changed due a lawsuit. Even the hallways leading to your room was dim...ridiculous!I cashed in my Starwood points for two nights at the W Seattle. Before arriving, I upgraded to a fabulous room, which is a corner room on one of the higher floors. The points were worth it: the room felt large, mainly because of the long L-shaped hallway leading from the front door to the bedroom area and the floor to (almost) ceiling windows that wrapped around the other side of the room. The robes were soft, and I couldn't get enough of the Bliss spa bath products. The bathroom was clean and efficient, but still pretty. The bed was great, too, although I wish there was more choice of pillows. Maybe a firmer one or a foam one? The office/business furniture in the room looked a little worse for wear, though, and for a place this pricey, internet access should be free, and the business center should expand its business hours; 9am-7pm doesn't really work for non-business travelers. Instead, I went down the street and used the public library's computers for free (your local tax dollars at work!). 
Check-in went smoothly, and the young woman at the front desk was very helpful and positive. Not quite what I expected at all. But the concierge--ugh. Both men that I interacted with were snooty and not very helpful. Maybe it's because I mainly asked about public transit, but I was told that both of them knew nothing about it or how to get a transit map. They could, though, look up a specific route online for me. That may have been helpful for dinner, but with a day full of sightseeing, I wanted more information while I was out and about. The barrista (barristo? it was a guy...) down by the Sculpture Park was way more helpful, pointing me in the right direction of the bus tunnel (transit center) as well as giving me a number to call Metro for bus times, directions, and lines. Really, W Seattle, you need to hire that guy! 
All in all, the hotel was fine. The view was great, street noise was low, location couldn't be beat, and, well, I used points so I only paid taxes and fees. If I was paying $300+ for a room, though, I'd expect a little more polish and finesse, both in the furniture and the concierge. The concierge should make you feel at home or at least well taken care of, and not like a piece of trash.Booking this Hotel months ago then reading all the negative reviews had us concerned about our upcoming stay. We did not experience any of problems (rude staff, dark rooms, etc). Actually we arrived 5 hours before check in. They met us at the front door and offered to take our luggage up the elevator to the registration desk for us. Although we were early their intent was to let us check into our room if it was available at no additional cost. Because it was not ready, they took our luggage and stored it for the day while we toured the city. When we came back for check it the room was still not ready due to a late check out so they upgraded our room so we would not have to wait and also gave us complimentary drink tickets to use at their bar. Room was great and , for the most part clean, but the blinds were very dusty when we opened them.Friends in American book this hotel and was really looking forward to staying at the W, as had heard about this chain.
The hotel is situated within the financial district, however is only a 10 mins walk to Pike Place Market and the Monorail to the Space Needle.
Our friends advised they had booked 2 spectacular rooms, but were not available on check in. (We had got a really good price on the room) Our room was not made up, but as only dropping things off and then out to explore the city was not too concerned. On return found an apology card and chocs!
Beds were really comfortable and had good nights sleep. However on the 2nd night we spilt water on bed and turned the bottom quilted mattress around to find a huge stain ! We were leaving the next day, and as friends had paid for 1 night as a gift to my fiance and I, did not want to say anything in front of them. On return to hotel on 2nd night found a DJ in reception and a party going on. Luckily neither of us on the 4th and 12th floor, did not hear anything.
Our friends were travelling with their 15 month old son and had called to ask about a cot and were told to bring their travel cot. When looking through the hotel information pack it clearly stated that cots were available and to call to request one.
Overall the hotel rooms were spacious and found them very comfortable. The reception staff friendly. If you are looking for a good nights sleep and like a boutique style hotel this is ideal. 
Hotel parking very expensive around $44 a day !!! Found one around the corner for $52 for the 2 days !We stayed here for 3 days over the summer and found the rooms were quote large (corner rooms) however did not have a great view.
Staff were quite okay, but did not help us with all of the bags (or offer to) when we went to and from the hotel. Unfortunately we were a small walk -5-10 minutes from many of the restaurants down on the waterfront and a 5-10 minute walk from Macys etc.
there were a couple of good restaurants close-by, including a subways and some great breakfast places.Passing through Seattle on a roadtrip, and stayed in the W for the evening. 
I like the W hotel brand. It's hip and trendy, and generally provides good service. That said, I can certainly see this type of hotel being an acquired taste. If you're looking for a luxury or business class room, and not worried about the experience, this may not be your kind of hotel. 
That said, the W met most of my expectations. The downstairs lobby area is indeed a lounge bar on weekend evenings, and the fitness centre was well laid-out and equipped. Rooms were standard, bed okay, bathroom clean and modern. The location, in central downtown Seattle, is good for accessibility to shopping and the sights.
My biggest complaint is, as expressed by others, the dark hallways. Yes, I understand the W brand, and its attempt at establishing an appropriate mood in all the common areas. But the hallways in the evenings are way too dark. You can barely find your room key in the lighting! Here's a suggestion -- if one wishes to maintain the hip mood of the hallways, just install some halogen spot lights or some track lighting in the hallway areas. This still promotes a hip mood, but allows the hallways to not look like something out of a scary movie.
Anyhow, despite this critique, I still really like this Seattle hotel, and I would return again when I'm in the area.When you pay $300 or more for a hotel room, you expect simple amenities, such as in-room coffee. Not here. Free in $40/night parking? room internet---not here. The wireless connection was terrible, only internet available was through the in-room ethernet. While I have stayed at many W hotels before, and enjoyed them, and while I have 2 daughters who live i Seattle, this will be the last time I stay in the Seattle W.The reviews I read before visiting the W hotel in Seattle led me to believe I was in for an unpleasant stay. However, I had no choice as the hotel was booked by my husband's company for a conference. The service was impeccable - everything was clean. We rarely saw the cleaning staff, but everything was always clean. The staff was also very helpful and friendly. The style is very modern. We really enjoyed having a comfy bench built into the entire window wall since we hung out with friends in the evening. I highly recommend this hotel.My boyfriend and I were trying to find a hotel for a long weekend stay in Seattle. We actually used Hotwire to book our hotel and our stay at the hotel was great. 
I was a little worried before our actual stay because of the over the phone customer service. I had called to request a king bed instead of two beds and also to inquire about parking (which is a whopping $42 a day with in and out privileges). I called a second time to inquire about an early check in. Both times I spoke to someone in customer service who talked extremely rapidly. I had to immediately call back once because I had been hung up on before I could ask my second question. This definately didn't make me feel welcomed and I hadn't even walked through the door yet! 
All that aside I must say that our actual experience there was pretty good. The hotel is in a great location on 4th street in the Financial District about a block down from the Seattle Public Library. It's easily in walking distance to the shopping areas, Pike's Place, and Pier 52 and the ferry terminals. Our check-in experience was quick and easy and everything I had requested in advance was granted.
There are a lot of complaints about the hallways being really dark and they are dark but I didn't mind them. The rooms are a little on the squished side but all the furniture is comfortable and the bathrooms are actually quite large. 
The W Bar is located downstairs and there are cute comfortable seating areas located around the bar but also between the bar and the front desk. The bartenders are friendly and will offer up lots of travel advice and suggestions if you ask. On the weekends there is a DJ but the music isn't too loud. I couldn't hear anything but my room was on the tenth floor.
I would stay here again. I just wish the valet parking wasn't so expensive! We ended up parking up the street on 5th for $26/night. If you can do without a car rental I would recommend it - parking in Seattle can be a nightmare!Stayed for 2 nights after a flight from Beijing. Lacks the ""wow"" factor that I've expreienced at other W and Westin properties (Westin Chaoyang in Beijing is more upscale than the W in Seattle). Is a nice, clean hotel in a great location, though if you're looking for a true W experience it's a bit of a disappointment.Valet parking is $44 per day, my wife paid $22 bucks for a in room movie. Add the local taxes and fees and your room rate really climbs. Room service is crazy expensive. 22% service charge plus outrageous prices for the food. Cool hip hotel but make sure you find out how much all the extras cost.My wife and I had never visited Seattle. We took our two young daughters and stayed 4 nights at the W Hotel. What a great pick...it is located in the center of ""downtown"", and is within easy walking distance of shopping and dining. When we arrived, the valet was right there to help unload our luggage from the rental car, and made us feel very welcome right away. Much appreciated when you are trying to wrangle two excited young children while trying to check in! The staff at the front desk were busy with other guests, but took time out to acknowledge us and let us know it would be just a minute or two. When they did get to us, they were friendly, and interested in not only checking us in, but in finding out the purpose of our visit. The young lady made a couple of sightseeing suggestions (the Seattle Aquarium, and a ride on a ferry boat across the Puget Sound, which was fantastic). We checked into our room and were pleased with the updated decor. The beds were comfortable, though a little small. We were even impressed with the maid service. Anyone traveling with children knows that keeping the room picked up is a bit of a chore. The maid organized items on the bathroom counter, nicely folded discarded clothes and placed them on end of the bed. 
We truly enjoyed the hospitality of the staff at this hotel, as well as the updated decor and the beautiful location in Seattle.Stayed there for 3 nights with a girl friend. I was shocked that this hotel was a W. Apart from the Lobby which has the W signature bar the rest of the hotel has to be a 3 or max 4 star quality. The towels and bed sheets in the room need to be used for rags! The bathroom still has the old bath tub from when the W took over including all the light switches. Called for a shower cap and had to wait 40 minutes to get it. Called for an extra shower gel which never came. Although a turn down service is offered they do not replenish ANYTHING. A quick flip of the comforter and done! No complimentary water bottle either. 
The Business Center is a joke. A man sat there with loud music playing. When we asked him that we had a letter to mail with ""signature request on receipt"" he tried to talk me out of it and said it was unnecessary since it was going to the IRS. When I insisted he said he could not provide that service and I should go across the street to the Post Office. Found out that the across the street meant 4 blocks away! 
Dont bother with the breakfast at this hotel. The choice is very limited and the service is the same. You are much better off going across the street to Starbucks for a predictable coffee and muffin at least you will get what you pay for.
On the positive note the Front Desk staff were very nice and the Bar service was excellent.
Certainly NOT worth the $325 a night tab. I would never stay there again and would certainly have moved out except there was a big game in town and a convention hence was stuck.I just stayed at the W Hotel in Seattle and was completely underwhelmed with the whole experience. Right from the beginning, I was shocked at the service. There were at least six valets but they couldn't seem to manage traffic and they didn't even bother to help us with our luggage. The guy at the door seemed distracted by his secret-service head piece and didn't even open the front door for us as we struggled with our bags. 
At the front desk, the woman who checked us in was really unfriendly, the lobby was a total mess (pillows everyone, empty glasses, an empty water pitcher and no sign of anyone replacing the water). 
I thought at least the rooms would be great, but we walked in and it looked like a Holiday Inn had been refaced with a plasma TV and some black and white photography. It was tiny, incredibly loud, the carpets weren't very clean, there were blinds instead of blackout shades, and the bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on in a ""4 star"" hotel in my life. Long story short, I was REALLY disappointed and will not stay at a W again.I got this room for less than $200 for one night, probably more than what I would've liked to spend. But it was well worth it for the location, within blocks from everything and I ended up walking everywhere (Pike's place, ferry, etc)
The hotel itself is your typical ""W"" if you are familiar with the chain. Trendy, modern, hip, etc. The room was spacious, bathroom had all the modern ammenities, but I didn't anticipate the night life. I knew ""W"" turns into a lounge at night but it was REALLY loud and in the entrance to the hotel. Being that I was in town for Mother's day with my mom, walking into the hotel at 11pm and hearing people screaming along the hallway was not what I was expecting. And by then there was no one at the front desk.
Would I stay here again? Probably not. The hotel is nice, and the location couldn't be better. But I'm not going to pay that much money to have a half naked drunkard jump into my elevator, which happened.
If you are looking to go to ""W"" for the nightlife, this is it. But if not, you probably want to go smewhere else.I stayed at the W from 25 July until 5 Aug 2009 on a combination of business and pleasure. All staff without exception were extremely courteous and helpful at all times of the night and day. The business section of my stay was handled professionally and in manner which reflected well on the hotel and my company in the face of clients. All my IT and conference needs were more than adequately met. The pleasure section of my stay was exactly that....a real opportunity to relax and enjoy all that Seattle had to offer. As an international visitor the W and it's staff provided a very positive image of America, and when I am asked in the future what I wish for, it will be nothing other than a W !The W Hotel is a fine choice for Downtown Seattle. It's in a great location with proximity to everything. It's trendy and has a lively bar scene that was hopping past 11pm on the Wednesday evening I was there. It's pricey, but in line with other W Hotels. The hotel is a little ""dark"" so you'll definitely be taking off your shades in the hotel!There's a lot to recommend the W. The location is great, the bedding really comfortable, and the room design is cool. But I somehow feel like they're so busy promoting the brand that is W that they forget they're a hotel first and foremost. For example, there's an iPod dock in the room, but you have to pay for wifi ($5/hour), which seems just crazy to me in this day and age. There's also no coffee/tea in the room, and no microwave/ coffee pot so that you can make your own. So if you want some morning caffeine, which seems like a pretty basic amenity, you either have to pay about $12 for room service ($6 for the drink, plus $4 delivery, and other charges) or get dressed and head out to the Starbucks across the street.
Also, the bar/restaurant downstairs is a total scene, which, depending on your point of view, is probably either really cool or kind of depressing. And the lighting in the hallways is so dark you can't even see your room number. Like another reviewer said, it's eerie, not cool.
All in all, there's a lot to like at the W, but I'm not in a hurry to go back there. With the wifi/coffee situation, I felt like I was getting gouged; with the scene going on downstairs, I felt like I had to get through a club to get to my room. It's not a warm place, so to speak, and I'd rather stay somewhere where I felt cared for.My wife and I stayed here during a trip to Seattle. I had read reviews saying that the staff were pretentious but I experienced none of this and they were professional and courteous throughout. The rooms were impeccable, the location was excellent. The beds were so incredibly comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.After 3 hours waiting to take off our flight was cancelled for our return trip to the UK. I and three customers were effectively stranded at 1 am , a quick phone call to the the staff at the W and they were quickly and efficiently able to get us rooms back in the hotel. They, were able to recover what was a difficult situation and make it an ""easy solution"" that everyone was happy with
Outstanding Customer Service, even by the normally, excellent standards of the W in SeattleFirst time staying at the W Seattle...
First the good...
+ Great location (can walk most everywhere you desire)
+ Cool lobby, restaurant and bar
Next the bad...
+ Not really worth the price (food, drinks and especially valet and internet)
+ Room smelled a bit like smoke
+ Gym is weak (except for those sweet stretching machines!)
+ I know they are going for a cool feel with the dark vibe in the hallways, but it is WAY too dark... I could even see my key to open the door. 
I might stay here again, but the only reason is to keep gaining Starwood points. The Hyatt Olive 8 is a bit better IMO (except for location) --Stayed at the W from Aug 2 - 5th, 2009. Could not find anything to fault with this trendy hotel in a great location. Easy to walk everywher. Very quiet, had a 'wonderful"" room on the 19th floor. No waiting for elevators, newspaper daily, very comfortable room with roomy sofa under window. DVD player, ipod dock, great bed, small fridge containing minibar.
All staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. Concierge right by the elevator always ready to answer questions or help plan sightseeing etc.
We did not dine at the hotel, lots of available options nearby from fine dining to casual breakfast places. 
Very trendy front desk and lobby / living room area. Elevators had great music, hallways are dimly lit, a good idea seems to keep noise down in the hallways. 
All in all a very memorable trip, can't wait to stay at the ""W"" again !We (my husband, teenage son and myself) stayed at the W hotel July 2009. We got a great price through travelzoo and it was centerally located for our purpose. Qwest field and Paramount Theatre. We had a king room with a daybed which worked out well for the three of us. Our view was of the top of the roof but it was a very quiet room. Everyone was friendly and the room was clean and the bath products were nice. All in all a nice hotel. Parking is very expensive (about $35) and there is not self parking.A large brawl began in the lobby with furniture and lamps being thrown like some kind of frat house brawl. The police as far as I can tell where never contacted as they did not show up. I asked to be transfered to another hotel --no such luck--no discount-no nothing. The staff acted like nothing had happened.I only stayed here one night, but my experience with the staff was entirely positive. I was greeted with a hello and a smile by everyone from the valets, front desk personnel, and housekeepers. The location is great, and we had a nice view of the space needle and a sliver view of the water from our room. The room decor is nice, and I especially like the built in window sofa.
What I didn't like is how dark the hallways are. I had trouble locating my room number. I don't think it's the right ambiance, more eerie than cool. I also don't think that having blinds in the window was such a good idea. They definitely needed to be dusted. It was distracting seeing all that dust on the window blinds when I was trying to see the view. Curtains/drapes would have been better, also for light control in the morning. 
Regarding the parking, due to a mix-up, I ended up parking next door. It only cost $26 for the night vs $43 at the hotel. fyi
So although I think this hotel is making an effort regarding the complaints about the service, they do still have a way to go regarding cleaning/dusting.This hotel is really nicely located in Seattle. You can walk to all shopping areas and to the Piers from here. Ask for the superior rooms. They are very nice and nice view. 
Don't go there if you want to relax or if you are looking for a quiet spot. It is a very busy area and the hotel itself attracts a lot of people and very active bar scene.The lobby and concierge staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a couple of Acura's with drivers who will take you wherever you want to go locally during the day. (helpful if you don't want to walk across town or don't know where you're going) The drivers were very nice. The rooms need to have curtains -- the room I was in only had blinds and it was light very early in the morning in July. Good overall experience. Excellent location.The hotel is 2 blocks from Benaroya Hall. The rooms are spacious, modern, and welcoming. The lobby is well designed and easy to use for meetings, either in the lounge or restaurant. The service and staff are far above average in both the positive disposition with which they serve their customer, and the seemingly effortless perfection of the entire experience at any time of day or night.I was led to believe that the W was a very luxurious hotel. Well it isn't in my opinion. The carpet could have been a lot cleaner, the towels small and worn out( not the thick towels that other hotels of this price range normally offer) and overall the whole place was just a let down. Won't be returning. I'll stick with the smaller boutique hotels that actually give something for the money.I have stayed at W Seattle three times now (once each in 2006, 2007 & 2009). And each time, my opinion of this property has dropped several notches. During my first stay, I found the hotel to be a warm, cozy respite from the hectic world outside. I was impressed by the trendy decor and friendly staff. The second time, I felt the same about the hotel, except that I had noticed that the staff was colder and didn't exude much of a welcoming attitude(especially one of the rude concierge team members). This most recent time (July 2-5, 2009), I realized that I am officially over this W location. The employees were very aloof for the most part - and the ones who weren't aloof, just weren't very friendly and warm. There was the lovely housekeeper on our floor who was cheery and happy. And there were also the semi-friendly bartenders, although one was telling us about how unsafe the parking garage is at this hotel and how many break-ins have taken place (!!) And don't get me started on the sleazy-looking concierge staff! The hotel is also looking a little worn-around-the-edges and definitely needs a little sprucing up. And the ""hip"" factor that the W Brand has tried so hard to establish is gone. Now it seems as though the hotel is appealing to a more low-rent crowd (there were the young couple who were being sexually active in the hallway as the elevator door opened and the guy came in with me, while zipping up his pants). I'm just over it. For my next visit to Seattle, I will definitely try one of the newer boutique hotels or the Doubletree Arctic Club. 
W Seattle is still a clean, comfortable hotel. I have never had an awful experience here. But it has just lost a lot of it's unique appeal - partly attributed to the unfriendly, unmotivated employees and the lack of a ""WOW"" factor. I would stay again, but would choose several other hotels first before making a reservation here again.We are SPG Gold members and have stayed all across the country at Sheratons and Westins. This was probably one of the worst experiences we've had. We were going to be in Seattle for a few days on vacation and unfortunately, all the other hotels in the area were booked solid. Apparently, the cruise ships take off on Sundays and most hotels are booked on Saturday nights in the summer. So we decided to try a W for the first time. Never again.
First off, the rate was ridiculous. We paid $264/night and the parking was $43 a night! When we first checked in, we had to ask twice for help with our luggage. The check-in staff were not especially friendly either. The concierge was very rude and it felt like we were a bother when asking questions. Not only that, but the guy gave us false information saying that it takes a good 3.5 to 4 hours to drive to Mt. Ranier and discouraged us from going. We went anyway, and it took only 2 hours to get there! 
The room was ok, albeit very small. Nothing spectacular here. The lobby was dimly lit and cramped. There was barely any room to move around when there were a large number of guests checking in.
We were traveling with our 2 young kids (9 and 4). The entire time we were there we got looks from the other guests. It really felt like kids were not welcome there. This was very discouraging. Our youngest child has a lot of food allergies, mainly peanuts and eggs. My wife had called a week in advance and talked to the front desk manager and the chef at the restaurant and told them about the allergies and what he can and can't have. They assured us that they would purchase the necessary items so that he could enjoy eating breakfast with the rest of us. When we got there, they had no clue about his allergies and had done nothing to prepare in advance! They offered him a bowl of fruit for breakfast. My wife was furious! They were told a week in advance about the allergies and still were clueless.
I will never stay at the W Seattle again and probably not another W period. If they are trying to cater themselves to the young and kidless clientele, they are missing out on a huge segment of business.The W hotel is in a great location in Seattle. We were a short walk in one direction to the monorail station, which we used to visit the Space Needle, and a short walk in the other direction to my favorite restaurant, the Metropolitan Grill. Of course being Seattle, we were surrounded by coffee shops that opened at 5 am (a good thing when you're coming from the east coast). My only issue with the W is the ""trendy"" attitude. It feels they go out of their way to make the W some type of cool destination that they forget about hospitality. It has a really great vibe to it, but after traveling all day, what you're really looking forward to is a friendly attitude. If they can learn to reconcile the two, this will be an amazing place to visit.As I am a Gold Starwood member, I was able to procure an upgrade to the top floors. What a view. As with all downtown lodging everything costs... $5 for a bottle of water, $6 for a bag of M&M's.... No wifi unless you want to pay $14... and parking @ $43 a day.... yikes. BUT if you want to stay smack downtown, within a short walk to Pikes Market place, this is as good as it gets. We took advantage of their concierge, a totally pretentious kid named Adam, he did not listen and proffered his agenda and interests. I agree with other posters who say the staff is not overly friendly.I know why this place is so poorly lit - it is filthy. The hotel is overpriced. The staff was rude - if you could even get one of them to speak with you. The room itself was disgusting. the walls were dirty, the shower curtain had mold, the floor appeared to not have been vacuumed in quite awhile, the walls had scuffs and if I had to describe it in one word - it would be dingy. The only upside was the location but it took over a half an hour to leave our car with the valet when arriving, no one offered to help with our bags or even hold the door. I would never stay this hotel again.The W was a nice hotel with clean rooms, pretty linens and great soaps/shampoos. I just didn't feel the experience was worth the extra money. Many other more affordable hotels will offer a similar experience. I enjoyed my stay but it wasn't anything special for the price.Was in Seattle for business during a week when there was an enormous international convention which completely overwhelmed the city. However, the staff at the W really gave it their all to try to accomodate all their guests and their needs. When the hotel is full, the public facilities (restaurant, bar and public seating areas) are inadequate, but again, the staff ran around trying to keep people happy. I had a corner room which was lovely and a nice escape from the crowds downstairs and on the street. It wasn't my first choice for a hotel (too big and young crowd), but the only one where I could obtain a reservation. I doubt I will return, but the staff really deserves some recognition of the incredible job they did recently. As with many high end hotels, you are nickel-dimed with internet charges. If the Marriott can provide internet for free why not these hotels?Stayed 3 nights for meetings in Redmond. Trendy lobby and nice rooms well-equipped. Service was as usual impeccable. Lobby is open on the bar which gets noisy in the evenings so if you need seclusion avoid the W.This is a bit out of date as I stayed here in Jan 2005, but I wanted to say that this hotel takes the cake in Seattle. It's everything you'd expect from a W... great decor, trendy bar/restaurants makes you feel like a celebrity, etc. I was here for 4 months and was always pleased with the staff and service. There's nothing bad I can say about the hotel, and if you are looking into staying at a W, you probably already know what to expect and this is pretty standard for a W, but great for Seattle.
The only drawback (I guess i did have something bad to say) is that the gym is small. So if you are a business traveler, you'll have to deal with a functional (yet small) gym.The W Seattle gives you everything you would expect of a W and more. With a cool vibe in the lobby and restaurant that extends all the way to the sleeping rooms. I received a corner room with a view of the Space Needle, the mountains and the city. It was amazing! The service was also very high quality and the staff was extremely helpful.From the minute I checked in it was a NIGHTMARE. I was loaded down with bags and a formal gown in a dress bag, the doorman just stared at me as I struggled to get the door. I handed over my AMEX black card, the guy gave it back to me and said we don't accept this card ...lmao I said EVERYONE takes that card. He said it doesn't feel real m'am, do you have another card! Ok [-], it's titanium. So I finally get a manager, get checked in, a bellman helps me upstairs (poor guy earned his $10 tip) we put my things away , I notice him go white as a sheet and he asks if I want to get a drink in the bar while housekeeping comes up to my room. I'm like no...why? Then I see him staring at a USED condom on the floor on the side of the bed by the end table! By now I'm [-]! By now my husband shows up. I call for the manager, I get the housekeeper manager instead, he cleans it up, promises my husband and I that while we are out at dinner he will deep clean the room. By this time we are running late for a fomal dinner... it was just a mess. When we went downstairs to leave for dinner the valet told us ""he was to busy to hail us a cab""! When we came back that night things were clean and we had cupcakes and milk waiting for us. What do I look like a 3 year old? I'm 32! We had arranged for roses and champange and got that and in the middle of it all we had cupcakes and milk...
We ordered that night for breakfast the next morning. It was over an hour late then the time we requested, cold , and they forgot half our stuff. It was a mess. We gave up and checked out. The staff was rude, the service sucked and too boot we are gold members and stay all over the world as Starwood members. But we are done with the W'. They have lost all class and service. They answer the phone ""What is your wish?"" How about some [-] service to start?First of all, the staff is very dry and not friendly. Second of all, they do not explain anything to you when it comes to hotel charges. Third of all, and by far the most classy of all, if you want to stay here and are interested in picking up some prostitutes in seattle, this is the place to stay. After hanging out at the bar with some friends on a friday night, we got to watch a couple of guys pick up some hookers at the bar. Top notch and classy. 
I will never stay here again! Not for this price!We booked this room as our company party was in the same building. The staff at the front desk was friendly, and the lobby is quite impressive. Unfortunately, those were pretty much the high points.
The hallways are very, very dark. Dark colors, low light, but easy to navigate. Our room was a corner room, and showed its age with many areas of chipped paint, luggage scuffs against the wall, and so on. The room layout was pretty good, with many amenities for the business traveler (phone/high-speed hookup, big desk, and so on). They seem to think very highly of themselves, with a big 'W' magazine, and a CD of music suggested by the 'W' (to listen to while reading the magazine, I assume). There were various other magazines filled with pretty people wearing $500 shoes and doing fabulous things as well.
We found it odd that they could spend the money on four different periodicals and supply every room with a small handheld silver kaleidoscope in its own holder, but didn't give guests Q-tips.
We wanted to get a snack before the party, and were directed to the bar. The prices scared us off...most appetizers were in the $20 range and sounded very exotic, which we took to mean tiny portions and lots of garnish. We ended up wandering over to the local Rock Bottom brewery and took advantage of their $3 happy hour offers, which were great!
In closing, when one rents a room, their primary reason is for sleeping. That leads us to the biggest disappointment. The bed at the W was comparable to sleeping on a mound of large potatoes. My wife's back was so sore in the morning that she had trouble getting dressed. I personally felt like I had been beaten with a bag of oranges.
I would only recommend this hotel to trendy young people who are expensing their room on their company charge card or those who really were trying to impress very urban people.The best W we know! The Front desk staff was so helpful and caring especially the manager. I broke my ankle while in town and they were so amazingly helpful and accommodating! Normally, W's kind of fell like a night club, you have to look the look or they'll shrug you off. This W still looked like the night club, but the acted like the St. Regis. Thank you!! The rooms were very nice and had great views of the city. Surely the best value for your dollar in town.Stayed 4 nights recently. Booked cheapest room and upgraded to a Fabulous room on 23rd floor with an awesome view of the bay and needle as a Gold member. Used the Acura service, which is free and will take you anywhere downtown. The gym was recently redone and was nice with new equipment and fresh fruit to eat...NO bottled water...boo!
They have a great Happy Hour till 7pm, M-F. The prices are cheap for Seattle so take advantage, get a drink and sit by the fireplace. 
Manager of the hotel was outstanding. I needed $10 dollars to pay for a cab ride and the ATM was disabled. I asked the front desk if they could add the $10 dollars to my bill and give me the cash. Front desk clerk said ""NO"" and manager said yes, no questions asked. Outstanding service. 
Location is perfect. Walking distance to everything. Pikes and shopping is all within 2 to 5 blocks of the hotel.I don't usually write reviews but feel like I should warn the unsuspecting. Worst hotel I've stayed in. Hallways are dark with a subterrain feeling. Rooms very small with LOW ceilings. No pop machines in the ENTIRE hotel. So either bring your own or pay $4 a piece from mini bar. Not a phone book in the room, had to call for one. Bed was comfortable and room service food was good. But the lobby was small and dark lobby with stairs down to fireplace, chairs, and bar. Also everything they do is by ""text message"" to you. This feels very impersonal, I like to connect to a person. Parking was over $35 a night!! We had an above standard room and we still were charged $20 a day after tax for wi-fi...I will never stay in a ""W"" hotel anywhere. Perhaps 20-yr olds would think this place cool, but anyone that has seen the world via hotels will NOT find this appealing,.I was dissapointed with my overall stay at the hotel. After travelling all day and arriving at 8p (10p my time) I had to HAUL my luggage up the STAIRS to the front desk. They all stood there and watched me struggle to get my luggage up, but were too cool to help. During check-in I had a few questions and the staff acted ""too cool"" to help and ignored half of my requests (two keys).
I have yet to see the lights come on in any part of the hotel -- very strange to have dimly lit halls at 10a. There is NO coffee maker or hot water in the room -- good luck if you want a cup of coffee or tea.
Prices are ridiculous and the towels and linens are cheap...they charge you to make a local call - come on!
A little too hipster and completely over the staff being too cool for their pants.The W Seattle lives up to the standard that is so consistent in W hotels around the country. I came for a conference (which was taking place at the hotel itself, conveniently) for two nights in early December. 
Hotel: As with all W hotels, this one has the trendy decor and chic amenities. We had a room on the 16th floor with a so-so view of the next door building and a bit of downtown. The rooms are a bit dark, even with all of the lights on. The flatscreen TVs are nice but small and ill-positioned. The beds are extremely comfortable, and they provided four pillows per bed, which was a great surprise for a pillow fiend such as myself. My favorite little extra is the bathrobes, super comfy and warm. The gym is perfectly adequate, and I was alone so I had free range of the TV in there. 
I found the front desk staff, valet, and concierge to be friendly, professional, and courteous. They would have gone above and beyond had we any special requests. I had forgotten contact solution, and they provided a bottle for me (small fee). 
Location: The W is located at 4th and Seneca, in the financial district but extremely close to downtown. We were a five minute walk to the shopping district (a perfect section for shoppers, including Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Macy's, and tons of boutiques and other shops). We were also only a ten minute walk from Pike's Market, including the famous fish-throwers and the endless rows of crafts, flowers, fruits, vegetables, and more. I strongly recommend strolling down to Pike's Market for a look around. Of course you can find a coffee shop on every corner (either Starbuck's or Seattle's Best). 
Dining: My new favorite Seattle restaurant is La Vita e Bella, an Italian ""cafe"". We took a cab but could have walked. The service was phenomenal, the food delicious, and the atmosphere very New York (without the crowds). We also ate at Matt's in the Market, an upscale seafood place right in Pike's Market (on the 3rd floor - ask around if you can't find it or visit their website). The food was too pricey, so I wouldn't recommend it, but the views of the market were nice. 
I definitely recommend a trip to Seattle, and the W is a fine choice for your accommodations. Location, staff, and W quality make for a relaxing trip, even when it's business-related.We stayed at the W Hotel for a romantic night in the city. I have always wanted to stay here, I have eaten in the restaurant before and it was beautiful. Overall this was a great hotel. It doesn’t really need to be said that it is an amazing property. The rooms were incredibly decadent, very modern décor, lovely furniture. Our room had a chaise lounge in it overlooking the corner windows which though it said floor to ceiling, the rooms are pretty short in height so it’s not as incredible as I thought it would be. However, don’t get me wrong it was still beautiful. The bed was incredibly luxurious and comfortable. The room was actually pretty big with a beautiful desk and the bathroom was quite swanky, though it didn’t have a soaking tub or jet tub which I had tried everywhere to find out and couldn’t on the website. It’s your basic tub with shower set up. Now I know. 
We were on the 12th floor so it was just city views, in fact we looked at the back of the Four Seasons. But city streets otherwise. Higher floors may have more impressive views.
It was quite a luxurious experience. My husband had bought me roses and so we called down and asked if they could bring us up a vase and within 2 minutes we had a knock on the door and a couple of options of vases. The location is great, it’s a little more in the business area of town, but only a couple blocks from some great shopping. The bar is actually in the lobby of the hotel, as in, it sort of is the lobby of the hotel so you can just sit by the fire or anywhere on the sofas or chairs and they will come and get your order. We did not eat in the bar or the restaurant so I can’t speak to that experience, though it looked lovely.
It was a little full of itself. Check-in was a little frosty, and the bar as well seemed a bit pretentious. But if you just overlook all of that and enjoy the hotel for it’s beauty and comfort, it’s perfect! We had room service in the morning which was amazing. The presentation was incredible and the food was tastey. It’s a rather pricey hotel, I found a great rate online the week of our plans so it was nice to get it all at a bit of a deal, but even so, it’s definitely a splurge. I would stay here again if I found a deal, but otherwise, I am not sure full price would have been worth it. Great location to the Fifth Ave Theater and some great restaurants in the vicinity within walking distance.We arrived on an early flight - and the front desk happily checked us in before noon. The room was large with nice decor- flat screen tv, long window seat, cool bathroom, etc... The bed was super comfy- similar to the Westin beds. Location was great-- Pike Place market, Pioneer Square and other downtown attractions were all a very short walk away.
We were also very pleased with the concierge's dinner recommendation- Flying Fish in Belltown.We often stay at The W Seattle for Football Games and Concerts and we always look forward to it as its always a fun place to stay. The service is very good and front desk people helpful and Happy. Being Platinum we always get upgraded to a corner room. The only negative is the Gym,small and dated,needs a big overhaul.
. The Bar area is really nice with well dressed crowd aged 30 -45 looking for a good time. Drinks a little pricey but the Bar Tenders poor them great .
We always use
www.sneakysunday.com to find the best places to eat. We love ZOE in belltown.Its fantastic.
Overall a great location and fun place to stay.
Give it a shotWell it all started when trying to get checked in and it was pretty much the same from there on out. I get it, they are trying to be trendy, but after a long flight and day of traveling I just want to get to my room and relax. Upon walking into the lobby on a Wednesday evening, all I could here was obnoxiously loud house music coming from the bar just down the stairs. It was hard conversing at the front desk trying to get checked in, the young man working didn't seem to care if I stayed at their hotel or not.
The room was ok, nothing special. You could tell a lot of time was spent to make sure everything was in its place, but you had the feeling that if housekeeping had to vacuum they would charge you for it. Turned out to be pretty much true, random charges for the in room mini bar(that I never touched), $.75/day for a newspaper I didn't want. The room and bathroom were pretty poorly lit. I'm surprised I was not charged for using the soap and shampoo.
The customer service was the same at the front desk throughout my stay as the first night I checked in. I'm sorry the conference I was attending happened to be stationed in the hotel(the only reason I stayed there). This place has great potential, but to be honest I've been to Motel 6's with better class.Stayed in Seattle for last 2 nights of trip and as Sheraton point holders chose W because of locality and luxury - it certainly turned out to be luxurious - if a little expensive!
Parking is a problem a if the hotel park is full, there are public parks but they charge $25 per day.
Check in was great as was the helpful staff when we asked if there were any smoking rooms. There was none on check in (we should have thought about this earlier) but they were able then to reserve a room for the following evening.
Rooms were great, half price cocktails on some evening an while there are restaurants nearby, for a special treat we ate in the hotel because of quality and standing of chef.
We ordered the 5 course meal where the Chef picks the dishes and also the special wine option where different wines complement the dishes . . a really good choice.
Several other small dishes thrown in as well as the main 5 so there was always something to eat.
Expensive but as they say, you get what you pay for - it was the highlight meal of the holiday.
very business orientated with conferences but this was not a problem for us - we liked the buzz.This hotel was a big disappointment, even given we paid only $179/night. In the past year I have stayed in hotels in Europe, Africa, the Carribean, and the US at all different levels [e.g., Days Inn to the San Francisco Fairmont] and this is the only hotel that truly annoyed me.
When we checked in it was nighttime - outside and inside. The lobby was lit only with tea lights scattered about. We simply could not see where we were stepping or what we were signing. 
I couldn't believe it!
There was also extremely loud music, with a booming bass line, blasting in the lobby each night. The younger people crowded about apparently enjoyed it but my party of four found it absolutely obnoxious. 
The lobby also had an unusual scent - sort of a combination of mothballs and incense; I never got used to it and could not understand why anyone would deliberately pollute the air of a hotel lobby with that noxious odor. Perhaps if I were a New Age type, as opposed to a middle aged type, I would have enjoyed it.
The room was clean but rather spartan. Bed was OK, not fabulous. Towels were a little chintzy. The biggest problem: the room did not have enough light for comfortable reading. 
The absolute limit was that the ""complimentary"" coffee service in the lobby was taken away at 9AM.
Good points: location, concierge was helpful, sufficient elevators.Currently beginning our second day. We travel with a nine-month old, and my wife had had an amazing experience at the W San Francisco so we hapilly signed for a five-day stay. Experience so far:
Hotel fitness center is undergoing renovations for the next month and a half, a fact the hotel neglected to inform us of until we arrived. When asked what other ammenities the hotel offered, we were informed that there were none.
When we arrived at our room, it turns out to have been smoked in recently, so we requested another room. which they to their credit took care of quite fast. That some staff obviously had knowledge of the state of the room (during room prep if nothing else), and the hotel still was not able to avoid this problem is an indication of little care.
We had requested a crib for our baby, but when we returned from a day of walking the city, there still was no crib as requested in our booking so we called down to reqeust one. The hotel then sent a person who seemed like he needed to check the room before believing that there was no crib. It was then brought in with no crib blanket. We called down for one, and a blanket that looked just like an airline blanket was delivered.
The hotel's tagline is ""Welcome to the W, what's your wish,"" Well, I wish they would provide customer service.I stayed for two nights at the W Hotel Seattle as part of a business trip. I chose this hotel as it was close to Pike street, where I would be spending most of my time.
LOCATION
The hotel is pretty central, and is not too far from the major sights of Seattle. I found it very easy to walk to Pike Street Market, the Space Needle, as well as get to other places I needed to be.
RECEPTION/LOBBY
The reception area is very contemporary in design, and very buzzing. Having said that, the reception experience left a bit to be desired. The reception staff seem to see themselves as the coolest of the cool, and as a result, seem to almost look down on those checking in! My receptionist didn't say good evening, or show any warmth. She just asked my name, and handed me the key... Would have been nice to be engaged a little more!
ROOM
I had a room on the 19th Floor, so pretty good views over to the Space Needle. The room looks modern and contemporary. The bathroom is fitted out to a high standard, but furniture in the room itself was a little bit shabby. Having said that, the bed was comfortable and I had no trouble sleeping.
OVERALL
An acceptable hotel, where the staff are a little arrogant, but comfortable and clean rooms. Having said that, If I had been paying, I don't know if I would have been too happy with the £150/night cost for what I got.My wife and I stayed at the W for 3 nights in June. I was very happy with the hotel, and we had a great time there. The staff was very nice and accommodating, and the room was very comfortable and modern. As usually, the W beds are awesome. The room also had a flat screen tv, a DVD player, and an ipod radio/clock. The bathroom was also comfortable, and they provide Bliss products. My only complaint was that one of our neighbors ordered room service, and the try say outside their room all day. Oh, and the hallways are unnecessarily dark, although that's not really a big deal. I think they're trying to be swanky, but whatever. The hotel is also in a great location. We walked to a Mariner's game our first night, and its also close to most of the shopping, restaurants and bars. 
We had dinner at Union and Crush while we were there. Union was very good and is only a short walk from the hotel. Crush was about a $12 cab ride away, but it was well worth it. I love food, and my meal at Crush was definitely one of the better meals that I've ever had.I had sinus surgery a few weeks before my trip to Seattle. The cross-country flight combined with drinking all day and crashing on a friend's floor with no pillow the night before all led to me having an INDESCRIBABLE headache the morning I was due to check in to the W. Check in is not until 3 pm, but the staff was more than happy to get me into my room at 9:30 am when I explained how badly my head hurt. And this was on a sold-out weekend. And both times I called downstairs for assistance they were friendly and helpful. Service = A+
The room itself was huge, stylishly decorated, and immensely comfortable. (That bed! Those pillows! Even the carpet was a treat for my feet.) My only complaint was the A/C..... some new eco-friendly deal I'd never seen before where there's a sensor and as soon as you leave the room it goes off. (We obviously do not have this in Florida!!!!) We were lucky to have GORGEOUS sunny weather so after trekking around town it was hot when we got back to the room. But it didn't take very long to cool back down. Room = A
The location was pretty much perfect - I was able to walk to all the downtown attractions and there is a public bus stop right outside the front door. Yes, there are hills as the previous poster noted, but that's not their fault! The whole city is full of hills! The incline varies depending on which side street you take; if you go down to Pine or Pike it wasn't bad at all. Location = A+
Full disclosure - I didn't pay for my room. My godparents allowed me to use their SPG points (23,000 of them!) to stay here. However, I feel confident that if I had forked over the $275/night or whatever it is I would have felt completely satisfied all the same.My husband and I are Starwood Preferred Gold guests and try to stay at Starwood Hotels at any chance we can get. Our favorite experience was at a W in San Francisco, so we were very excited about the W Seattle.
We arrived after flying all day from DC at the W late afternoon. There was no bellman out from to help us with our 3 suitcases, and we couldn't get through the front door because there was a crowd of 4 smokers rudely blocking the way. Once we got inside, there was a small line to check in, and some man walked in and asked if he could cut (no way!). 
I must say, once we finally got to the room, it was nice and modern. The bed was comfortable, but it was nothing spectacular. So much of a hotel experience is the customer service, and there really wasn't any customer service to speak of here. 
One other thing that I didn't love was that the hotel was perched on a VERY steep hill. My husband and I are young and fit, but after a long day of walking, it was always annoying to come into the lobby completely winded after hiking the hill.
I would not recommend this hotel- go for the Westin nearby instead!My husband and I are frequent guests of Starwood properties, in fact they are our preferred hotels. We typically stay at Westin's but wanted to give the W Hotel a try because we thought it would be a better, swankier hotel. 
While our dinner at Earth & Ocean was delicious, we were very disappointed by several things. 
The front desk and concierge were down right rude and not at all helpful. We felt as though they didn't want to be bothered by a hotel guest.
The workout facility at the hotel, in short, was downright awful. A hotel of this caliber cannot have such poor equipment in such a cramped, depressing space and expect people to believe this is a luxury hotel. Imagine a guest room with the furniture removed and then replaced with broken, out dated exercise equipment. Thankfully we had a friend in town who gave us passes to the Washington Athletic Club -- which was AMAZING.
We were also disappointed to discover that the W does not provide an in-room coffee pot. This seems like such a standard thing these days. Why don't they have one at this hotel?
Another thing that bothered us was the lack of lighting in the hallways. We actually laughed when we tried to get into our room b/c we couldn't see the card reader on our door. There is hip, and then there is just plain stupid.
Finally, we requested and received a room on one of the non-smoking floors. One of the other patrons on the floor ignored the hotels' rules and smoked in their room four out of the five days we were there (we assumed they checked out before us). We called guest services the first day, no longer able to tolerate the smell in our room, and were told something would be said to them or they would be asked to move to the smoking floor. They were not spoken to. After calling guest services again on the third day they told us they would move US to a different room...I couldn't understand why we would be inconvenienced instead of those who were not complying with the rules of the hotel. It was clear that they never said anything to the guests who were smoking b/c it didn't stop. We gave up and breathed in the smoke for the rest of our stay. 
Given that the price to stay at the W Seattle and the Westin Seattle are virtually the same, and the amenties at the Westin are SO much better; we will NEVER stay at the W Seattle again. I wish I had booked the Westin.The W in Seattle had the best bed ever - it was so incredibly comfortable. The staff were friendly, the views were great, and everything in the room was top quality.W Hotel Seattle - This is the 5th time I've stayed with you, and this is the 5th time you've tried to bill me for something never used in-room after checkout. I understand the occasional snafu in being charged for something every now and then, but this hotel has done it every single stay. It is clear to me now that the hotel is scrounging for money and will try to pass off false bills to your customers hoping they don't catch it on their credit card statements. Shame on you, and shame on me for staying with the W Seattle for a 5th time.
Get your accounting up to shape with the rest of the world... until then, you will not see me or anyone else I speak with as a guest.I stayed at the W over a weekend before having to move to a hotel close to the airport for the training I was attending. I had never been to Seattle, and decided to come a bit early to see the sights. I left my husband at home, and this was my first solo trip in quite some time. I chose the W for the location and the price, and the reputation of W hotels in general--I had never stayed at one before.
Let's start with the positives. The room was excellent--great decor, comfy bed, nice flat screen TV, great quality toiletries (although i question the scent combo of lemon and sage... too cleaning-product-y for me). The darkness and loudness in the common areas took some getting used to, but it certainly makes for a cool, chic vibe in the hotel. Very different from the average Marriott or Sheraton I typically stay in. I also enjoyed the free Wi-Fi in the lobby one evening with a great apple martini. Oh, and the location was excellent. Very quick and FLAT walks to the ""main attractions.""
And now, the negatives. As a married woman traveling alone, it took me a little while to be at ease with being on my own, especially dining solo and such. I went to the concierge desk on the first evening, having just arrived in Seattle an hour or so ago, and was hoping for a little encouragement and some great recommendations from them. Uh, no. Granted, partially my fault for wanting to be babied, but this desire came from previous experiences with concierges in other cities--usually they're excited to tell you where to go, what to do, and to introduce you to their city. Not so much with this guy. He acted totally put off and aloof and I felt like I wasn't cool enough or something. The next day, I tried again with a different concierge. He was more helpful, but definitely not at the level I'm used to. I was inquiring about the ferry to Bainbridge Island, and he told me all about it but didn't bother to provide a schedule. When I asked specifically where I could get a schedule, he said, ""Oh, I have one right here."" Um, wouldn't it seem the natural thing to do to hand that to me when you're telling me how to get there and how often it leaves?? 
While the concierge service is really my only complaint about the W Seattle, it was poor enough for me to knock the rating down to a 3 because, to me, if you're going to present yourself as a luxury hotel, you need luxury service to earn an above average rating. And I didn't get that here.As a Starwood Corporate Preferred Guest, I did not feel welcomed or appreciated at this hotel. Plain and simple! This was my first stay at a W Hotel and the first time that a Starwood property has not exceeded my expectations. There is a prevailing arrogant attitude and lack of emotion among the majority of the staff; however, Christine in the restaurant is an exception to this prevalent ""culture."" She has a wonderful smile and disposition along with a polished professional manner. It is unfortunate that the other staff members have not learned from her.
Upon arrival at the hotel, the music was so loud you could barely hear the apathetic Front Desk Clerk. The DVD in our guestroom was inoperable and had to be replaced. One evening, during our stay, we went to the lounge to purchase a drink to take to the room. The hostess did not know how process a room charge. Although we were eventually successful in getting our drinks and taking them to the room, the glasses were never removed from the room during our entire stay. One morning at breakfast, we reported, twice, that the lobby/restaurant men’s room was is disarray and needed attention. It was never attended to during our meal.
The whatever...whenever (concierge) desk is a joke. One evening, at approximately 11 - 11:30 p.m., we asked Adam if he could recommend a restaurant in the area that serves breakfast items. He relied that all the restaurants in the vicinity were serving dinner and that ""in my 6 years here, I have never had anyone ask for breakfast at this hour."" He eventually called the kitchen to see if they could prepare breakfast at that hour. After asking what we wanted, we said just a couple of ham and cheese omelets. Adam told us it would take an hour. The incident let us know that we were imposing and it was an imposition on everyone involved. Heidi and the others at the desk were not much better. To be quite honest, we ended up using the concierge desk at the Fairmont across the street. There, William truly made us feel welcome and wanted us to experience the best that Seattle had to offer.
The evening prior to check out, I enquired at the desk regarding utilizing some of my SPG points toward my stay. The clerk told me that it would need to be done at check out. The next morning as I was settling my account, I spoke to Jeff regarding my desire to apply some of my points. He stated that my account was already settled and who told me that my points could be applied at checkout. After explaining that that I was informed the previous evening by one of the clerks on duty, he stated that he would have to call Starwood to see about getting the points applied to my stay. After it was processed…no smile…no thank you for staying with us…just “there you go.”
Although the location is EXCELLENT, think twice prior to booking this hotel! (I wish I had.)...for the concierge problem. More on that later. We actually stayed at this W twice in ten days. Our stays bookended a trip to SF.
When we first arrived the cab dropped us at the restaurant entrance not the main entrance. When we got to the bottom of the staircase leading to check-in the bellman could not have been nicer. He got an extra guy to help with all of our gear. Both check ins were smooth, staff lovely, room was great. The second check-in was particularly nice, as one of the young ladies behind the desk made a special point to welcome my son back to the hotel with a high five and ""It's great to see you again"". Went a long way. We had a view of Mt. Rainier the first leg, lower down the second. Room service during both stays was excellent. The lobby was lovely to hang out in, the restaurant was very, very good. 
To the concierge problem...we dealt with three concierges during our stays. Two of which were fine, one simply didn't do his job or meet our requests. First, he was on his cell phone at the concierge desk and seemed annoyed that we interrupted him. We wanted to make dinner reservations for two nights and asked whether we needed reservations for a third restaurant. It was early in the day, he said the first two would not be open, but would make the reservations later and noted it on the computer. He then said we did not need reservations at the third. That was that, thanks!, and we were on our way.
Later that evening, we arrived at the 'no reservation' restaurant to discover a two hour wait for a table of three and ""Oh no, we ALWAYS recommend reservations."" Hmmm, basic info a concierge should know. We walked back to the hotel to check on the other reservations with the evening concierge. Neither had been made. He was very apologetic and expressed that this had been a problem for a number of guests that day. He took care of the reservations and found us another place to eat that evening.
Despite the intitial problem, it was dealt with in a more than satisfactory way and we would absolutely stay there again.Located in the heart of downtown Seattle, within walking distance of major shopping and tourist destinations. Great staff--very friendly and helpful. Room was spacious, with big windows, flat screen tv, desk and sitting area. Comfortable bed, but, strangely, only a thin blanket. Fortunately had thermostat in room, so we were ok. No coffeemaker in room, but free coffee in lobby. Nice stylish bathroom, but could have used a few more towel racks and hooks. Excellent restaurant and attractive (though expensive) bar. Free wi-fi in lobby, but not in the rooms, where you pay for wi-fi. Decor is very sleek and mostly dark. The lobby/bar area is very dark and trendy- looking in the evening. Comfortable seating--a good place to meet. Ballroom and reception area was perfect for our (200-person) event, and service was excellent.Nothing special about the rooms, actually very small. They over-charge you for everything, bottle of water $8, room service is a joke, small menu and prices are ridiculous! Went down to guest services for a key to the gym, and I guess since I was not wearing a $400 gym outfit, they did not believe me that I was staying there and had to escort me to my room for an ID to prove it, I was humiliated, and they didn't even apologize. Trust me a go for a Hilton!! Oh yes also they charge $45 a day for parking and $15 for internet.I don't usually have time to write reviews on travel rating websites but I thought I'd take a few minutes here to give some feedback on my recent W Hotel experience. I travel at least 4 times a year to Seattle solely for business purposes and I absolutely love Seattle! But more importantly I always stay at the W. I was just there a couple weeks ago for 3 nights and I just realized how friendly and wonderful the staff is there. Specifically Brian (I think that's his name) who answers the phones went way out of his way (I was feeling a little under the weather) by sending one of his employees to a local drug store to grab medicine. Not only did Brian have the medicine delivered to my room but he also had 2 cold gatorades brought up as well. Talk about talking care of guests which is why I will always stay at the W. Also I love the Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the mornings!Great location downtown. Nice but not exceptional rooms. $14.95 a day for internet access is ridiculous. Even more in the staffed business center - $20 an hour.
Free coffee in the morning. Flavored water or juice in the afternoons.
Charge me for the drinks, but give me free wifi!Writing this review a little late but figured I should send a shout out where it is deserved. My new husband and I stayed at the W Seattle for our post wedding getaway...honeymoon is coming to a tropical location! This was the perfect getaway to Seattle topped off with a great hotel. 
Staff at the W were fabulous and always knew how to direct our questions about the city. Super friendly staff all around who really help to set the W standard of Whatever, Whenever. 
Perfect location in what looked to be the business end of town, awesome restaurants all around, making for hard decision making for meals. A Starbucks directly across the street!! (It is Seattle afterall) 
Within walking distance of local market and sites. Monorail easy to access by foot and of course the Macy's and Nordstroms so close.
Loved our corner suite room and the generous bottle of wine gifted for our recent wedding. 
Would have loved to have had a refrigerator in room so we could have snacks and cold beverages, without breaking into the $$$ W snack/bev fridge. 
One must try the sexy fries and cocktails at the lounge bar! Oh and the bacon in the restaurant for breakfast, the best I have ever had!
The W Seattle had set the bar with service, decor, comfort and style. Love it!Very pricey for such a small room. Definitely a money grabber. Bathroom tub had definitely not been cleaned adequately and staff at the desk etc., lots of them don't go out of their way. Beds are great, lounge is terrific although the drinks are overpriced. Lounge food is good. I think I would stay across the street next time and just pop into the lounge for a snack and the music/ambiance.We stayed at the W Seattle and were thoroughly unimpressed. The hotel staff was excellent and very accomondating. The rooms were nice. However, having stayed at other W hotels, I was hoping for a more fun, happening hotel. The hotel seemed empty most of the weekend we were there. The bar is nice, but pales in comparison to other W hotel bars we have stayed at. Overall, I would not go out of my way to stay here. Don't get me wrong. It is a nice hotel. But.. just not what I had expected.Pros: Our room was spacious and updated, no problems with room or bathroom. Nice big double windows and lots of light (we chose a higher floor). Quiet. We liked the location and walked to the farmer's market, art museum, library, galleries, space needle, sculpture park, etc. Bar was nice but small and unpopulated (we went to many small local places and the busy Four Seasons on the waterfront nearby for drinks instead). Cons: While the help desk was great in person for directions and etc., calling for any amenities was not. We called several times for toilet paper (only had 1 roll for 4 nights/2 people), waited over an hour, and no one ever came. We finally tracked down the maid in the hall ourselves. Parking was really expensive at over $40 per day. Hallways dark as mentioned by others.Not sure why so many people like this place. I was very disapointed, maybe that's because I'm used to the great service and great rooms at the Hotel 1000. Tried The W for wife's bday to find my room dirty (holiday Inn cleans their rooms better). The customer service was horrible. The front desk person was like a robott or on something. Kept asking me how I was doingJust what I expected from a W. Cool vibe and great ambiance. Great location.Well, I've stayed at enough W Hotels to know that they're all about the same, which is most of the reason why people stay in them. You know what to expect, and you know what you're paying for -- which is: groovy electronica music playing in the lobby, candles lit at the check-in desk, west elm-y decor often in various shades of jewel tones, decent sheets and comfortable bed, and Bliss products in the bathroom. And this W was no different. We did get a nice view of Mt Rainer through the windows though. :)The location of this hotel is great. That's it. If you simply need a room, you can get something just as nice, for less, elsewhere. If you will need any kind of service: help getting cabs, dinner reservations, laundry, renting bicycles, storing your bags or even someone to hold the door as you struggle with your luggage, do not choose the W Seattle. 
We stayed for the Fourth of July weekend. We waited to talk to the concierege 3 times. Each time it took fifteen minutes for anyone to help us, and each time, the person in that position began his reponse by asking if we were sure we wanted him to check on our requests. For instance, I requested the conierge make an arrangement with a taxi for the end of our dinner. We were headed to the space needle afterwards. His response was ""well, I don't think you'll be able to get a cab tonight. It's really busy. Are you sure you want me to call? You should probably try calling them yourselves."" We had already called, and I don't fault the guy for failing (although, having bus schedules on hand seems like a prudent alternative), but of course I want him to call! I just waited 15 minutes to see if the W name would help us at all.
We cut our losses when we tried to rent bikes. After waiting 15 minutes, we weren't even the second group in line. Calling from the room did little good either.
Another time, I watched the concierge tell a woman that there was nowhere she could dine on the Fourth of July. Afterwards, I pulled her aside and gave her the list of places I had found on my own (I spent no more than 20 minutes on this research). I had already called the places, and all said they were slow for the Fourth and thus had plenty of room. Bear in mind that I had never even been to Seattle before that weekend. In fact, at the time of the conversation, I had barely been there 24 hours. 
I also have to mention that I did all of this research through my mobile phone because the W Seattle does not provide free WiFi. They don't want to help you find anything, and they don't want you to find it on your own either. It's like a casino where everything is designed to keep you within the establishment. 
We had to hail our own cabs right outside the hotel, and on our last day, as we were leaving, the doormen were too busy talking to one another to help me when I tripped going out the door. 
It was absurd. I feel it would be diffiult to reach this level of incompetence without some intentional effort. These people have forgotten that they are a part of someone else's rare and hard-earned vacation. Don't give them a chance to ruin yours.
I hear the food is good, but the service was so bad, I had no desire to stay in the hotel and try it.When the W Seattle originally opened, it was a great new hotel. I was coming to Seattle every month for work and loved each and every time I stayed there. 
My job finished and I had not been to Seattle for the past two years. 
I had the chance to come up to Seattle for a July vacation and unfortunately I picked the W. I am sitting in my room right now and waiting to check out and go somewhere else. This would be two days early. 
I am an easy going person, but this visit to the W has been a nightmare. I am not going to go into details, but I can honestly state that I have never been so upset that I demanded to leave a hotel early. I don't even have a replacement hotel, but I am very happy to leave this place.
The room was OK, the location great... but the SERVICE.... I think the staff here are still waiting for the training from corporate. I am still upset that they could not do anything right. Especially since we were paying full rates to stay here over the 4th. 
I used to love this place and hope that anyone who is considering the W Seattle will think twice.Our stay at the W Seattle had some great moments, and some not so great. 
+ Nice front desk staff upon check-in
- Front desk is up a flight of stairs which are not easy to negotiate with bags. You can walk around outside, up the hill, and enter on the same level through the side entrance
+Nice Corner room with lots of space
-No upgrade, even though a Gold starwood member
+Lots and lots of windows in the corner room
-Lots of sun, so the room heated up QUICKLY
+Fun peek-a-boo view of Mt Ranier
-Lots and lots and lots of street noise (8th floor) starting at about 5am. 
**The hotel is on a major diesel bus line, with a stop directly in front of the hotel, and the noise wakes you up too early. As does general noise from the street as traffic gets going.
+Excellent decor and fantastic Bliss branded products. Loads and loads of towels. 
-Room was worn (scuffed, chipped paint), bathtub/shower was only so-so, pillows were uncomfortable and cheesy plastic cups in bathroom.
+Allows dogs
-$25 a night fee, and nothing extraordinary in return; same dog amenities as the Seattle Sheraton or Westin.
The Bar
+Great happy hour specials
-TERRIBLE service on one occasion (forgotten food orders, difficulty in getting her attention. . .)
+Fun Environment on the weekend
-Limited seating
We also overheard the host for the bar telling a couple with a small service dog that the dog was not permitted. This is in direct violation of the law and the host did not seem to care. 
Location
Location is nice being near some shopping areas, and it's an easy walk to Pike's Place Market, but again, the road in front of the hotel is VERY VERY busy. You really have to hike to find nice outdoor dining, and you are aways away from what I consider the central area (Nordstrom, et. al). 
Dog owners, the Library is one block up and has plenty of grass, so it's a great place for doggy bathroom breaks.
Overall:
If I got a screaming deal on this hotel, as I did this time, I would stay again. But the location is not where I prefer to be and the street noise is out of control for weekday stays. I would request a higher floor to see if the steet noise was any less up higher. I'm also miffed about the $25 pet fee in comparison with Sheraton, which is $0.My best friend and I were coming to Seattle for my birthday, and wanted to stay someplace really nice. I thought I would save a few bucks instead of stay at the Hotel 1000 or the Alexis, just to have extra spending money. Boy, do I regret that decision. The staff was snobby, and completly self focused. The room was alright. It was NOT worth the $260 we paid though. The bathroom was crowded and grimey. We had like a yard sale quality iron and ironing board. It was just a bid disappointment all in all. Though I will give them credit, the beds are comfortable, and the lobby is nice. Thats all I can say about the W.Rooms were nice and comfy. I loved the bed, my husband didn't. The bar was very busy in the evening. Good location.My wife and stayed one night here while waiting to get on an Alaska cruise the next day. Upon check in we were wowed by the decor of the establishment but the front desk and bell boy were too snobby. They think they are celebrities or something....not friendly at all. Overall the room is nice and clean and the location was great.We planned a night away for our 6 year anniversary. It's not often it happens with young kids, so we were pretty excited. We checked in and although it was really busy, (it was the weekend of the Seattle International Film Festival) the staff was fairly attentive and checked us in not too long after we arrived. We had requested a room w/ a view, which we got. It was beautiful and we were impressed they had remembered. When we entered the room, this is where the great impression stopped. It was dirty, walls were heavily scuffed, the furniture looked worn and droopy (best word I could come up with). The glasses and water bottle seemed as if they had been sitting there for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer. The bathroom was fairly typical and not luxurious like I thought it might be. So all in all, I was a little bummed. I guess with paying $35/night for parking and having to pay for high speed internet access, we just expected more. The bar and restaurant service was amazing, although expensive. So all in all, it wasn't a horrible experience, but for what we paid, we just really expected a little bit more.This was definitely a hip hotel. Even on a school night, as the night went on, the bar got more and more crowded. The bartender was very accomodating. The checkin desk is not at street level (on the main street). The hallways are very dim. The room itself was pretty big, and it had a bench all along the window. The cordless phone was helpful for work I had to do. The bathroom was very nice (Bliss amenities). I was a little annoyed that they charged by the minute to use the internet in the business center. Given their high rates, they could include that. It was an excellent location.The W was exactly as expected - its in a great central location in Seattle downtown, is minimalist, and hip and very clean and well-run. The room was high-tech (i pod charger and docking station, etc). The price was also competitive (with Marriott Waterside). They had Acura test drives there that would take you within a 2 mile radius for free which was cool! If you like W's you'd like the W Seattle. I'm differentiating it from the Fairmont across the street which is extremely elegant and traditional (and more formal). It's a matter of taste.The location is wonderful. Just a few short blocks to the waterfront, shopping, the monorail, etc. We stayed 3 nights in a Cool Corner Room on the 23rd floor, with a spectacular view overlooking the Seattle Public Library. The bar/lounge area is fairly small and it's always packed. It's a fun atmosphere though so we stopped there every afternoon or early evening for a quick drink before heading out. The concierges had great recommendations for restaurants. Most of the staff was amazing but a couple of them could use a bit more customer service training.
If you like W Hotels, you'll be pretty happy with this one.W's are just great! Great service, attitude and location. Can walk to just about everywhere in downtown Seattle. Rooms are clean, fresh and so comfortable.I always liked the W. It's very simple and clean. I loved Seattle, the food here is organic and fresh. The hotel lobby and the room was fantastic. 
They gave us a suite instead of our room. About 10-min walk to the town, very close to shopping.Went away on a girls weekend and stayed at the W..wasn't sure how it would be, but ended up loving it! I typically play it safe by booking at a Fairmont, Four Seasons etc., but now I'm totally converted. I will absolutely consider the W wherever i go on future adult getaways.
The cost of the room was minimal and the room was large (corner King suite), actually they upgraded me for free to this room now that i recall. Ipod dock was a nice touch. Loved the cool vibe of the hotel once you come through the doors, from the lighting to the decor, very hip and sexy - just makes you feel more stylin' to be there. Yes the lighting in the halls was dark, but i must say i loved it even though i got turned around almost every time i stepped off the elevator - oh well i was on vacation. That was another plus, hip elevator music - refreshing. Lot's of activity in the Lobby at night, DJ spinning..etc very cool. Staff all young, so much so i wasn't sure i could count on getting my wakeup call, but it came right on time. Room service was fine, cereal not covered up with anything which i found odd - for sanitary reasons it should have been. a few minor glitches with service, but always attended to promptly so no complaints. 
I actually missed the feel of the hotel when i got home, will plan another trip to Seattle just to stay there again and get back to that relaxed cool vibe..(especially for the price).
I would not recommend it for a family getaway, but definitely for adults and if you like hip cool places you will be very happy here. If not stick to the Fairmont etc.This W has a very trendy, scenester-y downstairs bar that can be a lot of fun. However, I'm a woman who has to travel on my own for business and the whole thing can feel vaguely unsafe. The hallways are kept very dark - I guess they think it adds to the ambience. But wandering a pitch black hotel hallway by yourself can feel creepy, especially if you factor in how drunk many of the guests are. I've stayed here a couple of times and have been woken late at night by the sound of someone trying to get into my room. I think it's an honest mistake and happens because the hallways are literally pitch black, but it freaks me out, nonetheless! If you are looking for a place to party in Seattle with friends this is a great option. But if you are a woman traveling alone, skip it and stay at the Westin or Sheraton instead.Lobby smallish first glance almost uncomfortable due
to the street gradient that splits the lobby at one level
and a more comfortable lounge area down.
Low lighting in hallway..read dim. If you own
Hendrix and Doors vinyl read dark. Room great size.
King bed, large desk with bar cabinet, mini fridge
and a printer. RJ45 connections and power port
on top of desk. Missing a drawer to be a real work
desk. Double table lamp
Smallish closet. In room safe unable to fit a 15' laptop.
No coffee station. If you need your caffeine only
room service can do it or slide down to the corner
Starbucks.
Sofa like bench seat full width of window that is full
width of room. Large ottoman for feet or laptop.
Great area for lounging and watching the LG
flat screen. Remote has buttons that light up when
touched. Nice..
Good size night tables with 2 way lights. A Tivoli
clock radio with Ipod dock. A great sounding radio for
a hotel room. 
Vey spacious room but could do with an arm chair
to complement the window sofa.
Bathroom fair size. Not large. Sink vanity
glass countertop, full width towel bar...great
design. Make up/shaving mirror. Excelent
quality Bliss amenities. 
Wireless @ USD14.95/24hr. Valet @ USD35/day.
Great location. Easy walk to Pike Place Market or
Pioneer Square. Also mere blocks (3) into the
heart of shopping. Though in evenings as in many
downtowns rather bare and quiet.
Service at par with the brand. A solid 4 star. Not a 5.
Needs a separate shower stall and larger bathroom, larger lobby and more F&B to be a real 5 star.
Still is fine room and nicely done overall. Stay again?
Yes at the right price.I recently stayed at the W Seattle. I was hesitant at first to stay at this hotel as I am not fond of the trendy hotels. At this price point, I usually prefer hotels such as the Four Seasons. However, I needed to stay here to meet with business colleagues. I was very pleasantly surprised with my experience. I loved the hotel and would definitely stay here again when returning to Seattle.
The hotel has a very modern, hip look and feel. The rooms were very nice and spacious. They had a very comfortable feel to them, especially the large sofas against the windows. The staff was very pleasant and accomodating. The front desk was very welcoming. The blow dryer in my room was not working. When I alerted the front desk, it was replaced immediately. I ordered room service the first night. The food was good, and was delivered promptly. I liked the extra touch of the candy Nerds that were included in the delivery. I also ate breakfast and lunch at the hotel's restaurant. Again, the staff was very nice and service was prompt and efficient. 
The location of the hotel was central to everything. It is a few blocks to the Seattle Art Museum and the marketplace. It was within walking distrance to the monorail to the space needle and also to Pioneer Square. If you are looking for something fun and unusual to do, there is a great underground tour in Pioneer Square. The only negative to the location is that the area is quite desolate at night and there really is not much nearby except other hotels and office buildings.
All in all, I really enjoyed my stay at the W Seattle and would highly recommend staying there.I came here for a company conference in Jan08 and while the ambiance is classy, the overall feel is average for 5 star hotel. 
The hotel had a night club feel to it after 9PM and it was limited to dining option. the location was superb.The W was awesome. They had little donuts and cider in the afternoon in the lobby, little bottles of water in the lobby (free, as opposed to the $8 water on your night stand), and perfect apples. The hallways are dimly lit with that cool ""pimp"" lighting, and everything is immaculately hip. The valet was a bit congested but the location of the W makes it unnecessary to drive about downtown Seattle. There's a Starbucks across the street which makes it easy to grab and go for breakfast instead of sitting down to a fancy breakfast in their excellent restaurant downstairs. We really enjoyed the DJ's on Friday and Saturday night in the busy bar downstairs - be aware though, drinks are not cheap, but I did have the best lemon drop ever! We had a Spectacular room, with limited water views on the top floor - and the little lounge area in the room was so comfortable, perfect for relaxing with a drink. The room was excellent, and for the first time, despite all my business travel in five and four star hotels, I almost didn't want to leave!The rooms and facilities are fine and actually quite spacious, but the problem is the size of the hotel (c. 18 -20 floors and 20-30 rooms per floor at least) which justs make you feel like a cog that passes through without touching the side. Bit of a mixed metaphor I know, but if you like 40-60 room boutique hotels you will know what I mean. All the staff were friendly and helpful, just never saw the same one twice. Good sized gym and location also a plus. Few issues
1. the water they leave at the side of your bed is not complimentary (there should be a label telling you this), it is an eye watering c.$12 after tax are added
2. in room internet is like $15 plus and is not even free in the business centre - this in the homeland of Microsoft
3. food trays seemed to get left outside of rooms for a long time.
As I say nothing major wrong - just too big for my taste.I have to say that my stay at the W Seattle was absolutely fantastic and we could not have asked for anything more. We booked the memorial day rate - which was a fantastic deal for this hotel ($179/night)
I didn't park a car so I really didn't notice what others have said on this board as a ""congested"" front entrance. The Check-in staff were super friendly, and willing to accomodate us in every possible way, including upgrade to a higher floor. The concierge (Adam) was extremely helpful and spent a good 20 min talking with us about places to go, things to do in the city. Kevin the bellman was also extremely helpful. 
Yes, the hotel caters to a hip and trendy clientele, which is the reason Starwood introduced this chain of hotels in the first place. I would not recommend this hotel for families or those who are looking for some peace and quiet. The lobby is also a bar/lounge with DJ spinning in the late evening. Fantastic spot for younger crowds/singles who are travelling on business. 
The rooms were very spacious and comfortable (with very comfortable beds!). 
The hotel is in walking distance to restaurants/shopping and tourists attractions and of course multiple Starbucks! I would definitely stay in this hotel again!While our overall experience at the W Seattle was positive, I will admit to some ambivalence about the place.
My wife had expressed an interest in staying at the W so I booked a stay there as part of a Mother's Day weekend celebration. Shortly after booking the room through the Starwood website, I received an email offer to upgrade to a ""Spectacular"" room for $30, which I accepted.
I also requested to have a special music CD playing when we entered our room. Via email I was connected with Adam Sinding who was my ""Insider"" for this request. I arranged to drop off the CD the day before our arrival. Adam was not there when I arrived for the drop-off and I was referred to the young concierge. She struck me immediately as affected and pretentious. I believe she had been trained that ""putting on airs"" somehow enhances the status of an establishment. I just find it off-putting.
Be prepared for awkwardness on arrival at the W. The drive-up entrance is extremely poorly laid out. You basically are in the street when you pull up and configuration of car/pedestrian access to the check-in area is convoluted and congested. To simplify our arrival we just parked in the adjacent (to the east) Olympic Hotel parking garage and walked the 100 feet or so to the entry.
Check-in went very nicely with the staff at the desk very friendly and helpful. (A quick note about staff, they seem to be uniformly amazingly young. This means that you should not expect a great breadth of experience in the hospitality industry.) Guests observed in the lobby area seemed mostly the t-shirt, grungy blue jean, running shoe crowd. This seemed a bit odd giving that the W is not really a cheap place to stay. 
One of the most striking aspects of the Seattle W is its decor and darkness. Lighting in the halls, elevators and other public spaces without windows is incredibly low and techno. For instance, one needs to be quite close (within a foot or two) of a room door to discern the room number. My wife called the decor ""urban zen"" and I think this is probably as good as any moniker.
Our room was extremely nice and spacious. And yes, the CD was playing at an appropriate volume when we walked in. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room had very large windows with peek-a-boo views of Puget Sound. A full size chaise was along one wall next to a very nicely equipped desk. The bath was large and had more towels than anyone could use. The faucet handle on the tub/shower was close to breaking so controlling water temperature and pressure was quite difficult. 
When our car and driver arrived to take us to our evening activities we again were reminded of the extremely poor layout of access to the hotel. The combination of arriving and departing guests, aggressive taxi drivers whipping about and traffic wizzing by make entering and exiting more than an adventure.
The Earth and Ocean Restaurant on-site again is very much on the trendy side. We found the staff extremely warm, friendly and professional. The menu selection could only be characterized as super-trendy. Fortunately, the W is in the heart of downtown so there are dozens of super dining options for those not in an adventurous culinary mood. 
One minor annoyance is that I still don't have a breakdown of what this little adventure cost. Apparently, the W billing system is not capable of providing an up-to-date itemization of charges upon check-out.Ok I am a Starwood member and have wanted to stay at the W. The baseball teams stay here. The rooms were spacious and the staff friendly. Nice artwork... BUT No coffee pot in the room? This is Starbuck's flagship city. The lobby had LOUD techno type dance music blarring even early in the morning. I am not sure what their target market is but I heard more than one person complaining about it. At least play something I recognize, like Jimi Hendrix. The halls are dimly lit which I didn't like it. Some may call this hip and trendy, I call it, I won't be back!I have never stayed at a W before, I have had many a martini at the San Francisco W but never stayed over night. 
The W Seattle is not as impressive as the San Francisco location. The lobby of the hotel is chopped into two different sections, reception and the living room lounge area. The reception is where you first enter and leaves a lot to be desired. Check in went smooth except that they stuck us in a room that looked out on to a parking garage (we asked for a nice view because it was my husbands birthday). Once we were switched we were fine with our room (even though no assistance was offered to move our luggage).
The main problem that I had with this hotel is that I felt that it was trying to be so hard to be cool and hip that they over did it. I mean who really wants to walk into a blue dimly lit hallway at 10am or listen to house music in the restroom when you are heading out to breakfast. There is a time and place for these things and the morning did not feel like that time.
Another strange thing that happened during our stay is that 20-30 young people were staying at the hotel (in their teens) and all the hallways reeked of pot. One day they camped out in the lobby and were sprawled across the couches and by the fire drawing pictures, reading magazines and on the floor taking naps for hours. No other guests could access any part of this area during this time.
Although we got a great deal and the hotel was in very easy walking distance to everything, I would probably opt to stay at one of the many other hotels in the surrounding area.Dimly lit facilites and noisy rooms. Not an appropriate hotel for a business trip with hosted business meetings actually in the hotel.
Heard neighbors next door and upstairs through very thin walls and floors. 
Very good room service food. No issues with billing, and mostly helpful staff.
Bottom line: Great location but very noisy. Not a good place for business meetingsI found the W Seattle to be as advertized - trendy, pricey and spectacular. The rooms are more spacious than other W's I've stayed at and the service was impeccable. The views of Puget Sound and downtown were nothing short of breathtaking. If you don't mind spending a bit more, the W is for you.I booked a great on-line rate for the W Seattle for a weekend in March and then got nervous when I read the reviews here. I'm happy to report that our stay was a positive experience. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and comfortable (though terminally trendy), and we had a great view over the downtown area.
Parking was a bit pricy, but that's what you get at a high end hotel in a downtown area when there's no other options.
I'd stay again.I stayed at the W, Seattle in January 2007, and I have to say I was quite disappointed in the service. Firstly, I should say that it is a well designed hotel, so I definitely appreciated the ambiance, however, service was not very good. Upon entering our room, the toilet was dirty! When we complained about it, they did offer to switch our room, which was a nuisance since I literally unpacked everything! But they promised it would be an upgrade. To our dismay, the only difference with the new room was that it had a built-in bench by the window instead of two chairs. The other problem was that we asked for hot water to make baby formula. They told me I had to pay $6 for that... to make baby formula! I couldn't believe what a rip-off that was. Unfortunately, it was late in the evening, so I just paid the ridiculous price. I would have just boiled hot water in the coffee maker if they had a coffee maker like their room booklet said they should have, but of course, after having opened for 8 months, they said they still were ironing out the kinks. The one positive thing is that I complained about this issue the next day, and they did reimburse us for the water, but if first impressions are important for a classy hotel chain such as the W, I can't say that I was very impressed at all.I usually try to stay at Starwood hotels because I am a member of their points program. The W Seattle is the hippest Starwood property I have stayed at!
From the well decorated rooms, stunning reception, friendly staff, to the wall hung LCD in my guest room... Amazing!
I felt pampered just sleeping in the most comfortable bed I have ever had the pleasure of resting on.
The mood the the W Seattle creates from the second you Valet your car to the end of the night when you close your eyes is pure chic.
Do... Experience W Seattle!Stayed here in October for a birthday weekend trip. Absolutely loved it! We booked thru Starwood using Starwood points and had a corner Wow room. They were right - walked in - saw the room and view and said 'Wow!'. Room colors are very monochromatic with a splash of color here and there in pillows etc. Bliss products were waiting in the good size, modern bathroom along with the W bathrobes. The corridors are dark but it just lends the theme to this very modern, younger set location. Seattle, we found, attracts the vibrant, young go-getters. The downtown area is brimming with fabulous restaurants, cafes and other nightlife. Every member of staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The concierge was very knowledgable and was always kept busy. The hotel had lots of sitting areas. So, rather than being restricted to your room if you wanted to surf on your laptop or do some work, you could be part of the action and enjoy the fireplace and couches in the lobby or couches in the quieter section on the second floor. They played the best music all the time - like dance/house. Loved it! They had W candles burning all over, emanating a wonderful aroma/atmosphere. There was free Starbucks coffee in the bar area in the mornings. This little tidbit alas, we did not discover until the day we were leaving. The info was on a small card in the room but we missed it. There is a full service Starbucks right across the street. Being Seattle, there is a coffee shop on EVERY corner it seemed. 
We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant the first morning. The decor was impressive but the service and food was lacking - especially for the price. This was our only disappointment. We would recommend that you grab your free Starbucks, walk a couple of blocks towards Pikes Place and enjoy breakfast in one of Seattle's great cafes. The Crumpet Shop for one is well worth a visit. 
The hotel bar was well stocked and the atmosphere pleasant in the evenings when it seemed to attract the high-flyers of the city.
The location cannot be beat. Only four blocks from Pikes Place with LOTS of restaurants and shops in between.
You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here. Just be aware that it is very modern and 'hip'. If you want something more 'traditional' stay at the Westin.I have to echo other's concerns about the astronomical expenses (parking, room service, etc) and poor service at the W. I stayed at this hotel with a couple of friends expecting a pleasant stay at a swanky hotel. Realize that the money you're paying (and you'll likely pay a lot) is mostly for the ambiance--although rooms were utterly lacking in character and the nightclub lighting in the hallways was almost creepy, the lobby says it all as far as this hotel's trendy aspirations. We made only two minor requests during our stay, and on the second one ( a request for silverware) we were lectured that we would be charged for our next ""non-revenue"" request. Apparently the whole ""whatever, whenever"" motto should come with another line: ""for the right price."" Staff seemed like they couldn't be bothered, room was bland and unimpressive besides a nice television and a comfortable bed. The hotel is in a good location, but so are a lot of other nice, less expensive hotels that offer better service, like the Olympian across the street or the Westin. Unless you get a very good deal at the W (<$150/nt), it's not worth the money.Stayed here in July with my boyfriend for $200 a night. We found the hotel very romantic and were not bothered by the dark hallways. Our first room had a very noisy air conditioner - but after a quick call to the front desk, we were moved to a new room with no problems and a better view! Our room was beautiful - I especially enjoyed the bathroom and comfy bathrobes! The bed was so comfortable! We also worked out in the gym, which while very small is fine for one or two quick cardio workouts.I stayed at the W in Seattle for 3 nights from December 11th on business. 
The rooms are lovely, really tastefully decorated and a huge comfy bed with everything in perfect working order. Certainly couldn't ask for more from a hotel room. As I was there on business I can't comment too much on the overall hotel itself as I left at 7.30am without breakfast and got back after dinner each night after 10pm to go straight to bed! However, I can understand why people might think that the hotel is stingy with extras as the bottle of still water that is normally provided free of charge in hotels like the Hilton was $8.00 (albeit the bottle was large)! The price marked on it was so tiny that I didn't notice it until I had opened it after waking up in the night with a thirst. 
The reception of the hotel was very trendily decorated and was very dark. I loved the little touches like the door mat at the front of the hotel saying 'Good Evening' 'Good Afternoon' and 'Good morning' depending on the time of day. The valet staff were great too - they literally ran into the road each morning to flag down a taxi for me. 
My colleague stayed at the Hilton around the corner and was very envious when he dropped by the hotel to see me one day - considering he had paid a much higher price for his room, he would much rather have stayed at the W.
Finally, I was quite surprised to walk in on my last evening (Thursday) and find a DJ playing music and lots of people who were not guests sitting in the lobby bar drinking and dancing - the hotel felt like it had suddenly turned into a nightclub and was packed out. I certainly couldn't have sat there and had a quiet drink, so went straight to my room. I think it's a 'novel' idea but not really what I want or expect from a hotel........ It definitely caters for the younger set (20s to 30s). If I was staying there with a family or as an 'older' couple I would want to know about this before making my reservation as it might affect my decision.Do not stay here unless you want to be ignored, put on hold, charged un realistic amount of money for room service, I just do not understand this click of a hotel concept whom would possibly want to 250$ and up a night for these experiences?? Could someone please explain this to me???
Stay at the Fairmont Olympic next door great service, super friendly staff very welcoming made us feel totally at home and we were not even guests aghhhhhh...............We have never had such a bad experience at a hotel. The service was the worst I have seen, and the costs were astronomical. $8 for a bottle of water, $70 for two days of parking, and $80 for a cheese and meat platter that was stale (and that's 1.5 hours after ordering). Fire alarm testing at 9am (which lasted 40 minutes), without any pre-warning. The valet was rude, and actually stuck out his hand for a tip. The concierge was not helpful, and on two ocassions, turned and walked away.
Conclusion: We wouldn't stay here again, even if it was free.The hotel is dynamite. Incredible rooms and furnishings. Flat panel TV's. Cool lobby. Hip front desk staff. Great concierge.
Got great hotel treatment as a W The Card holder.
Do avoid the restaurant. The staff are terrible. We waited forever to get seated in an empty breakfast seating. Ten minutes to get water and coffee. IHOP does better!
Guy next to us complained about food and another couple waited so long for a hostess (Still 90% empty restaurant) that they sat themselves.If you like the minamilist look this is the place for you . Busy lobby and public spaces but serene away from them. Service was first rate . Will stay here again.i just spent two nights this past weekend at the w hotel. after reading all of the previous reviews, i was fairly skeptical of this hotel. however, i was pleasantly surprised. the hallways and elevators weren't nearly as dark as i had expected, the people at the front desk were polite and not cold and/or rude, and nothing was messed up with our reservation. the rooms are beautiful and spacious (we were staying in a base level room). i found the layout aided the spacious feeling. we were at the end of the hallway, so hearing the elevators was not a problem. our room looked out onto the fairmont hotel, and i admit i looked enviously at the pool across the way. we visited earth & ocean for dessert one night. the desserts were tasty and artfully done, but were really tiny for the price. we visited jasmine, a restaurant on 4th street to the right of the hotel. it wasn't anything spectacular: the tuna sashimi was better than the salmon. the service wasn't so good. we also got dessert at shucker's, the restaurant to the left of the w hotel on 4th street, in the fairmont hotel building. the dessert was fabulous - blueberry blackberry pie with sour cream ice cream - flavors complimented each other, and the size was generous. the menu looked pretty good, as far as oyster bar restaurants gohowever, if you're planning on spending some good money on wine, bring your own wine glasses. 
regarding the valet parking - we didn't have to pay for it because i found an offer online at the hotel website that offered a discounted rate ($209 per night), free valet parking, and double starpoints. i couldn't believe it was valid for weekends. make sure you check out the website for the current specials. there's no way i would've paid the $30+ for parking.Just returned from an excellent weekend in Seattle. A friend was attending a conference there this week, so I joined for a 36 hour trip to Seattle. W Hotel is in a great location downtown--a few blocks from Pike and shopping. 
It does tend to play up the ""hip/trendy"" atmosphere with an attractive staff--definately seems to cater to the late-20's-30's crowd but I think anyone would be comfortable there. 
The bedding is simply marvelous--high quality mattress topped with a feather bed, down duvet, and lots of pillows. My friend and I ended up with a two bed room and while four probably could fit, the beds seemed more like doubles than queens--not sure what their real size was. It ended up working out great for us though. There is also a great large window seat that a doubles as a soft. We had a great city view on the 17th floor of the Seattle Public Library next door. (see photos)
Wireless internet access is free in the lobby and the first three floors of the building (the conference center) and there are plenty of chairs and sofas around. It adds to the trendy atmosphere to actually have a buzz in the lobby. The charge per day for internet access in your room seemed excessive. 
The bathroom is well appointed with great Bliss products--lime and sage soap, facial wash, body wash, and lotion. A bottle of mouthwash would be handy for the hip/trendy crowd, I think. Bathrobes are included and soft and fluffy. Tube is large and water pressure poweful. I had no problems with housekeeping while I was there...my room was cleaned quite well. 
Breakfast was better than average at the lobby restaurant at typical hotel breakfast prices. They didn't start serving until 7.30 AM which seems a little late on the weekend if you're used to Central or Eastern time. 
All said, I'd certainly stay here again.The motto of this hotel is ""Whatever, Whenever"". This claim of exceptional service is the reason that the W is very highly priced. Our family checked in late on a Sunday night, and asked for an extra blanket. After 4 phonecalls to the ""Whatever, Whenever"" line, and 80 minutes, the blanket arrived in our room. On our 2nd phone call which was 45 minutes after we requested the blanket, the assistant manager with whom we spoke said that she would follow up on the blanket and call us right back. She did not. In the middle of the night our message light started blinking (although we were not on the phone and did not receive any phone calls). In the morning my husband called to retrieve the message, and was told that we did not have one. The message light continued to blink. Later, at about 9am, I called to try to retrieve the message, but after 30 rings with no answer, I gave up. I called the manager on duty to express my dissatisfaction with the service. He was apologetic, but did not offer to compensate us in any way, for example by waiving the $31 parking fee. Since our return home, we received an automatic email asking for our comments on our stay. I replied with the information herein. I have received no response from either this hotel or the W chain. From this set of experiences, I would conclude that the W is not at all interested in traveller satisfaction. We will never stay at a W again!Very nice quality room. The couple of small maintence problems were taken care of quickly. Had a room on the 19th floor for four nights in July. This building is short compared to the surrounding buildings. The location is within short walking distance to much of the downtown. The view from the room was the only disappointment. If a good view is an important factor to you, choose a different hotel.This tale of woe is in regard to a one night stay on July 15.
In the mood for an in-town get-away, I decided to surprise the Sig Other with a surprise night in a W Hotel suite. Upon checking room availability online, I saw no suites were available, so I called the hotel and learned that all their suites were being renovated. Fair enough, so i decided to reserve a corner room on a high floor.
I arrived at the hotel 30 minutes after check-in time to process the check-in and get my room keys so that later I could return with the SO and go right to the room. Upon arrival, I was met with huge lines at the check-in desk...it took me 20 minutes to get to the front desk. 
Now that it was nearly 4:00pm, and having waited in the very slow line, I was stunned to learn my room was not yet ready. I had to be home within an hour to meet my SO and still had to secretly pack a bag with extra toothbrushes, PJs, etc. I was told they would work as hard as they could to get me a room quickly. 
In the meantime, I decided to arrange for a bottle of Champagne to be in my room upon arrival. I was ushered to the Conceirge, who basically could not have been less interested. When I asked her if she was certain they could have the bottle on ice in the room at 5:30pm, she looked at me as if I were from outer space. I should have known this was only a hint of things to come...
Well, I was driving home to frantically pack, and then drive back to do the room key, then drive home to meet my SO -- yeah, I really like him so I go to this kind of trouble LOL -- when the guy at the desk called and said the room was ready. So I threw a few things in a bag and drove back downtown to get the key.
Surprise! Another epic line. And people were yelling at the desk clerks and general mayhem was ensuing. Apparently, there was only ONE single bellhop for the entire hotel on a busy Saturday. Genius. Well, while waiting in line I told several people about tripadvisor.com so hopefully they will post here, too.
I got to the desk, got my keys, and was running back out the door and said, ""You won't forget the Champagne, right?"" And they all smiled and said it was all set.
One hour later, I arrived and told the SO that some friends had invited us up to their room for a pre-dinner drink. I entered room 2120 to find...no Champagne. 
I called downstairs in a wee bit of a rage and was told ""We knocked on the door but no one answered so we didn't want to come in and disturb anyone."" I replied that no one had answered the door, because I wasn't in the room and since there was no Do Not Disturb sign on the door and since I had requested the bottle be waiting for my arrival, I was dismayed, mystified and peeved that they had blown the one most important element of the surprise overnight. Completely unacceptable at any price, but at $300+ it was ridiculous!
They said they would have the bottle right up there and I said they were welcome to send it up if they would give me a break on the price, otherwise, forget it. She said she would do what she could.
Which was, in a word, nothing. The bottle was delivered with a full price bill. I was insulted. I told the man that I was refusing the bottle and to take it back (it was unopened). He mumbled something and left the room without removing the bottle! I had to call down and ask for the bottle to be collected which it was.
We ended up drinking the half-bottle from the mini-bar. After taking showers, we discovered there was only one bathrobe. I called down for one, and it was delivered quickly (albeit on a wire hanger...all the hangers in the closet were wood, so this looked tacky.)
The room is nice, in fine shape, and the view was spectacular. I can say that much.
At check-out the next day, the clerk was very apologetic and comped the half-bottle of Champagne when I told her of how completely unpleasant the experience had been.
The W is very much form over function. I guess Seattle still doesn't have an interesting, cutting edge, non-dowdy, non-business-drone hotel. I would never return to the W and plan to share this opinion with my friends and fellow frequent business travelers.Remember SNL's Dieter (Mike Myers)? That's the character who came to mind when we thought about who designed this place. Contemporary throughout... felt like we should all wear black, even the hallways were barely lit. The value is comparable to every other downtown hotel...pricey. It's in a good location. We walked everywhere from Chinatown to the Space Needle. The piers & Pike Market are easily walkable. Every person from the front desk, concierge, luggage people, housekeepers, etc was friendly & helpful. The beds are incredibly comfortable, & the room was clean. The elevators are turbo-charged... no waiting. Expect to pay a lot if you want to use the services from local dialing, in-room movies, breakfast, parking, etc. If you can afford it, it's a nice comfortable, helpful, friendly, trendy stay.we stayed there for 3 nights in july. put me in the ""over priced/trendy"" camp.
the service was hit and miss. the check in was incredibly slow. however, we did find the staff to be friendly and helpful.
yes, the bed and plasma tv are great, but everything else about the room was average.
$30 a night for valet parking was a bit of a shock. all in all, i you pay more than $150/night to stay in this hotel, you're not getting your money's worth.It was a very nice getaway for one evening. I loved the decor, the bed, and the colorful pillow accent. I also like the long window sitting area. 
Best use of SPG Starpoint in Seattle, especially when the Westin and Sheraton are both at 10,000 point level. Having stayed at all three, I would highly recommend W above the other two.
I would also recommend using the parking structure on the same block, at the corner of 5th and Seneca (instead of valet), if you want to save some money.
The building location doesn't seem to allow for any water view, but it was a fine high-rise view on 22nd floor corner room.
The only minor complaint is the low-lighting in the elevator, common with all W. It's a bit uncomfortable to ride up with strangers.The hotel is very clean and did provide expensive valet parking. The shampoo and conditioner provided were very nice. However, beyond the shampoo and conditioner, you will pay for everything else at the hotel. Business center charged $.34 per minute for internet usage. No free wi-fi or even local phone service. My short local phone calls racked up charge of up to $5 a piece. The hotel will nickel and dime you and food including breakfast is too expensive. On the positive side, the was a very nice plasma tv in the room and the beds were very comfortable.I have stayed at this hotel at least 5 times over the last 2 years and have never been disappointed. The customer service is excellent, the rooms are spacious and I absolutely love the decor. 
There is an ambiance when you walk into the lobby which words cannot describe. Candles burning everywhere, comfy sofas, music oozing you into quiet contentment. 
Highly recommended for professionals & single couples.Very comfortable and funky hotel. The decor and overall experience is clearly targeted at younger professionals and vacationers, so for older or more conservative travelers, this hotel may not be your cup of tea.
The hallways are dark with very dramatic blue spotlights throughout, which is very effective and funky. The room was clean and very well appointed with a large LCD TV, DVD player, minibar, a copy of Wired Magazine, and modern decor. The bed was a 10 out of 10 for comfort and felt exactly the same to me as the Sheraton ‘Sweet Sleeper Bed’ offered at some Sheraton properties (W is part of the Starwood / Sheraton chain). The bathroom was large and had a cool frosted glass counter with a steel sink suspended in it.
The only hiccup in our stay was a mix up at check-in where the king bed room which we had booked wasn’t ready yet. Because of this, we had to wait about 45 minutes while the room was cleaned, but they gave us a ticket for 2 complimentary for cocktails in the lounge while we waited. 
This hotel is a bit pricey, but well worth it if your expectations are high. We will stay again.Can't explain why I'm not rating 5. Spacious rooms, W bed, great window ledge seat and fabulous service. Just seems to be something missing. Perhaps I'm unfairly comparing to a recent stay at a brand new Westin resort. Only concrete criticism is robes designed for people with chest size under 42"". We had a great stay and would stay there again. The restaurant recommendations by staff made the trip as perfect as it was.The W Hotel is very expensive for what it offers. The hall ways were dark and it was difficult to see the room numbers. The Staff was not very friendly.We stayed at the modern W Hotel in Seattle in mid May. The service was excellent; the room service, the welcome desk, the restaraunt/bar staff were all very helpful. We arrived a little early and they advised us that our room was not yet ready, but they could put us into one that was ready but the view was not as nice. We opted for them to hold our luggage and wait for our room and it was well worth it. They gave us a few locations that we could go to for a light lunch while waiting for the room.
The room was beautiful. We had a corner room on the 21st floor that had city and Puget Sound views. The room was extremely clean and well taken car of; we didn't feel gross walking around in bare feet or that others had stayed in the same room before us. 
The location of the W is spectacular. We walked to the piers and then to the space needle. We were only a few blocks away from Pikes Place Market and the whole shopping district. The W is only a couple blocks north of the Pioneer Square area and Qwest and Safeco Fields. We walked everywhere and didn't need to use the free bus zone or taxi's. 
The W is a wonderful hotel, luxurious, and centrally located to everything you may need.I stayed here 2 nights for my business trip. Aside from spacious room and unique ambiance, the service made me feel like I'm treated very special. You never get confused which number to press when you need to order food or set morning call. You just press ""Whenever, Whatever"" button and they will help you all the way out whatever the problem is. I really loved their Bliss bath cosmetics kits as well. 
The only thing I didn't like was they kind of charge you what you usually expect as free in many other hotels. For example, I drank mineral water at my bed side (I think it's generally complementary in other hotels) and I only learned it cost $10 for the bottle when I saw my bill at check out. Also they charged me $5 for the Internet cable. (They do not have wireless in the room) 
Overall, the experience was great, and I think I might stay again here if I visit Seattle again.This was my third stay at the W Seattle. As Seattle locals, we have enjoyed the W for a weekend getaway ""in the city"". We are Starwood Members, and enjoy most of their higher end properties.
For this overnight we were attending a Fri/Sat conference at the W. We stayed in a corner room (awesome view of Rainer) our favorite. The beds were heavenly as always.
We did notice that the W Seattle has slipped slightly. A little tired. Perhaps a management change? Perhaps it was the weekend? Not exactly sure - but they certainly were not quite on their ""game"" for our visit. Maybe they are doing better catering to the business crowd during the week. Still four stars, but missed in several areas. 
My complaints --
Front desk staff - indifferent at best. Gave us a low floor, dark room with parking lot view. When we asked to change, they indicated they were only 63% full, so changing was not a problem. Hmmm...why didn't they give us a decent room to begin with? 
Rooms - why can't the W provide wireless connection (at no charge) in the guest rooms? We love the technical ammenities the W offers, and my husband had free wireless connection in the W's meeting rooms. But the guest rooms only have wireless for a fee ($17 or so/day). The $8 bottle of water so high priced. Nice that it was bedside, but really $8 for water?
Concierge- openly complained about another guest in front of me. Tacky. We scheduled a couple things with the front desk/concierge, not sure who made the mistake, but after several calls to confirm, we learned that our appointment was scheduled on the wrong date (a date we weren't even in the hotel!) Fortunately we were persistent in getting the information.
Service - My husband left a distinctive power cord at the meeting. Called several times to the front desk with the request to look for it. No response. Called again to talk to the technical folks. No luck. Asked again at check-out. Blank stare.
My raves -
The car valets (""wheels"") are awesome! Grabbed a jacket for us. Always pleasant. Upon check out, it was such a treat to have two bottles of water and lemon wipes and our car waiting. Now that is a nice and unexpected touch.That's the W we remember!
That's a long of way of saying, we like the W-Seattle. It's good, perhaps very good, but our last stay was just so-so. I don't think we would rush back. What we have liked in the past, now seems quite ordinary. I would probably consider it for a business trip, but look elsewhere on the weekend.Stayed one night before heading west. In order after our arrival: The valets were excellent. The check-in was very smooth; we were upgraded for no particular reason, which was nice. We had to use a keychain LED flashlight to find our room, however, since the hallways were so dark. And this was mid-afternoon. Still, the room itself was excellent. Nice window seat, no awful polyester florals, super comfy bed. We had drinks and a snack in the lobby bar before dinner -- good. If you are easily intimidated by trendy young things, the lobby bar might not be for you, as it was full of them on a Saturday night. We grabbed dinner suggestions and a reservation to Metropolitan Grill via the concierge. Good job there, if a little non-committal about where we ought to go. Breakfasted in the restaurant the next am -- very civilized, if pricey.The room was disappointing. The furniture was very scuffed, and the walls had some stains. The staff was somewhat friendly, but more better looking than actually helpful. The exception was the valets, who were consistently doing a great job.
For the money, better accomodation can be found in Seattle.I heard so much about this hotel that I thought it could not possibly live up to its reputation. My company has an event in downtown Seattle every year and books blocks at large hotels here. I typically stay at Marriotts but wanted to check this out for a change. 
I did not eat in the restaurant so cannot comment. I did get room service for breakfast which was good, not great though and pretty high priced. I did get a spectacular room on an upper floor corner King. Breathtaking view and window bench.
I wanted to spend more time here than I actually did due to business commitments. I could die in the bed it was so comfortable. The most comfortable hotel bed I have slept in, it was hard to wake up. I loved the ""all black"" attire of the staff. The staff is very young and hip looking as others have said, but friendly and accomodated all my requests. The bathroom could be bigger or have more ""counter"" space to put your products. 
The hotel bar is booming like everyone says. But I did not feel intimidated to be there. Also the dark lighting in the hallway was not a big problem for me...I am a female and felt safe.
The Westin is closer to shopping and attactions (Spaceneedle etc). Though it is only a short walk to these places, again being female and alone, I would not suggest it in this area. I am debating on whether to stay at the Westin next year for its proximity, but I liked the W so much I dont know that I will chance it.I stay at the W each time I do business in Seattle and am rarely disappointed. The decor is nice, the rooms comfy and love the Bliss products. The location is excellent as well. However, it should be given the rates.
My only complaint is the workout facility. For a pricey hotel that caters to the business traveler, it should be larger. Make sure you get there no later than 6 AM if you want to get on one of their five pieces of cardio equipment.My wife met me on the west coast for a romantic getaway. We decided on the W based solely on the W reputation. We were pleasantly surprised every step of the way. Right in the center of Downtown Seattle, just blocks away from Pikes Market and great shopping and a very short cab ride from the Space Needle. 
The room was very roomy and the bathroom has the signature ""cool"" stuff all around. The view was beautiful. Just make sure you get a room on a higher floor. We stayed in a ""Cool Corner"" room which had amazing views of the city and the Space Needle. Some reviews say the hallway is ttoo dark but we really dont linger in the Hallwayy too much so it didnt bother us one bit. The rooms are bright and comfortable. 
We covered the city in 3 days and hit a few bars each night. We ended up at the bar in the hotel lobby at the end of each night. This bar is the place to be. The bartenders are two of the best that I've seen in a few years. These guys take care of the customers. 
Overall, great hotel, with a great atmosphere, and great service. 
We will return to this hotel!!Decent size room, very comfortable. Nice window seat to chill out on (not that I had much time to do that). Only stayed 2 nights but would have happily stayed there longer. Good room service, great food. Only downside was I thought the bar was a bit dull, not enough going on and a bit too small. Nice lobby area though to relax in when hung over. In walking distance though of some other good bars. Next time I'm in Seattle will stay again.The W Seattle lives up to the chain's hip image. Our room seemed a little small for a suite, but was beautifully decorated in white with dark brown wood and had a cozy window seat that was great for reading. The bathroom was rather large for the size of the room and was stocked with white terry robes and Bliss Spa products. The airy lobby seemed to fill around cocktail hour and would definitely be a fun place to hang out if we'd had more time. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant for the last night of our anniversary trip, which was well worth the cost. We knew the food would be good, but we were really blown away by the quality and imagination of the dishes as well as the excellent service and attention to detail (I used to work for the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain so I pay attention to small details). While many appeared to be eating there just to be seen, my husband and I couldn't stop oohing and aahing over the food. We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Seattle!I was at the W on business recently, and have stayed there before. The hotel has many things going for it (terrific pillowtop mattress, nice linens, Bliss toiletries, spacious rooms). The bar is, as already mentioned, pretty well-known in Seattle for its scene (although not as much as some Belltown places) -- but that's part of it being a W. 
My only gripe with the W is that after spending what, for Seattle, is a small fortune, they still won't provide free internet or local calls. If Starwood truly wants to build a boutique hotel brand, they should try acting like a boutique hotel, and stop trying to nickel and dime their customers.Dont stay here if you want to sleep! The buzz words at this hotel are ""whatever, whenever"" and that applies to the guests' attitudes as well. It is a party hotel and the guests who want to party, have fun, while the other guests grit their teeth. We stayed here for 3 nights in December 2005 and had one night of rest. The other 2 nights we had a group of guests in rooms around us who stayed up, with the music on, until 5 am. I called security several times and they did settle down each time for short periods but then they would start up again, talking, laughing, slamming doors. I will never stay in a W Hotel again. And the coffee at the hotel was the pits. In the ""city of coffee"" they should have at least got this right. Too cool for school is what I think it is all about with this stylish joke of a hotel. Shame on you.
ctWe moved to the W from the terrible Alexis hotel and loved it. The room was comfortable, the staff were attentive, the bar was great, and we got a great deal through the Sheraton website. Highly recommended!Pros: On the whole was an enjoyable stay. Rooms and bath were clean and the beds had crisp sheets. The room was well appointed (amenities like DVD, Audio Players were a nice touch) including the furniture. Minibar was well stocked with items including toiletries. 
Cons: The service was good but could have been better for the price. It would have been great if they included items like free Internet connectivity and simple items like a complimentary bottle of water.
Comments: Agree with the other review that the lighting in the halls and public places could have been brighter (atleast twice as much) without sacrificing the ambience that they are endeavouring to create.My wife and I stayed at the W for three nights last weekend. This was my first stay at a W. I decided to stay here based on the location and the fact that I was able to get a corner ""spectacular"" room for about $250/nt. The lobby is dark and full of ""younger"" guests and visitors. This did not bother us although we being 57 yrs old did not spend alot time there except for using their complimentary wireless internet. Our room had a spectacular view of the harbor and Mt Rainer. We thought it reminded us of a small NYC apartment with a hallway entrance into the main part of the room. They pride themselved on the whenever-wherever system, which means if you want something ask for it. We had to ask for Qtips and shower cap and they arrived quickly with no problem. The bathroom id not luxurious but still nice. The breakfast at the restaurant was very good with tipical hotel prices. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel.I just returned from a 3-night business trip at the W Seattle. The hotel is located in a fabulous downtown location at 4th & Seneca with easy (less than 6 blocks) walking access to shopping, restaurants, and Pike’s Place Market. My room was larger than in other W’s I have recently stayed and equipped in typical W style…comfy bed, hip furniture, and a neutral (tans & grey) palette. The lighting in the bathroom was minimal, yielding a pretty dark bathroom (especially over the shower and commode). Toiletries are “Bliss” brand and smell good! The overall hotel service was fair (efficient but not overly courteous check-in, prompt room service, awful valet, & good housekeeping). Less attitude than some W’s and more than others. Overall, it’s a good hotel. I paid $345/night, which makes me question the value proposition given the vast array of great Seattle options. I personally prefer the adjacent Fairmont and the nearby Grand Hyatt.I'll admit I'm a bit confused by the negative reviews of the W Seattle. I had nothing but positive experiences.
The W Seattle caters to the hipster 26-35 crowd. Think running shoe designers, web moguls and fasion mavens. People wearing sunglasses in the elevators, that sort of thing. I guess that comes with the territory; the W certainly is trendy.
The W is swathed in a somber, seriously cool style from the swank lounge to the luxurious rooms. The beds were plush and comfortable. The room felt like a modern apartment instead of a hotel. Accents abounded: stereo system, superior waffle robes, even a zen desk waterfall. The bathroom was stocked with luscious Bliss soaps.
The staff was friendly and efficient. I was able to check in hours early with no issue. They replaced a lost room and bar key pleasantly, without charging for the loss as some hotels might.
I skipped the bar. It was a bit too much of a 'scene' for my taste. If you enjoy the company of young beautiful people in the latest fashions you'll love it as the bar was thriving.
One (minor) drawback was that the W is tucked within canyons of corporate high rises and there is little of interest in the immediate area. A 10-20 walk will take you to most of the tourist areas like Pioneer Square, Pike's Place Market, etc. however.
Nonetheless, I'd stay there again. Amazing comfort.I had high expectations about this hotel based on reviews and referals from friends. My expectations were hightened when we received an e-mail from the hotel inquiring about our needs. Since our plane was arriving at 10:30 from LA, I requested an early check in. When we arrived I became disappointed. When we exited the cab, there was no one there to help us with our luggage. We had to struggle to get it through the door. Usually we carry our own luggage but after dragging it through the airport, I was looking forward to the service the W advertised. 
Check in went fast and we were given our early check in as requested. 
The hallways were dark as other people mentioned. However, they we not as bad as some stated. The room was big with all the amenaties. The bathroom was especially nice. The room was decorated in a trendy contemporary style which we like. However, when we went down to the lobby in the evening, we were surprised how much the hotel/resturaunt transformed into a posh party place. I thought we would fit in but not so. I am in my mid forty's and felt out of place. This hotel is great for the younger croud but I would feel more comfortable at the Fairmont across the street. 
We ate at the resturaunt for breakfast and was surprised at the prices. However, after visiting a couple other hotels in the area, we found the prices were only a little higher than average. I was very surprissed at this as we travel to Hawaii often, where prices are very high, but these were even higher!
When we checked out, I was surprised to see we were charged a $60 early check in fee. I didn't mind paying the rate but was upset, as I was never told we would be charged for this service. 
To sum it up, the hotel is very nice and trendy for the 20's and 30's couples. The service as advertised leaves a bit to be desired but overall a good stay. If we come to Seattle again, I will probably stay somewhere else. Not because of my experience but because the hotel is more for the younger scene.This was the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are huge and extremely well presented. The wonderful beds were in fact more than wonderful. I must compliment the hotel on the surprise gift I found under my pillow, which was a nice touch. I have heard some complaints from others on trip advisor calling the hotel creepy. This could not be further from the truth. Sure the halls may be a little dark and beetlejuice-esque, but this all adds to making the place different and special. The lobby is spacious and beautifully decorated and the bar is a great place to sit down and relax. The Staff were friendly and very helpful. I especially liked my wake up call on a Monday morning at 05.30am when i was told ""Welcome to Monday""!
The location is very central, and perfect for anyone staying in downtown Seattle.ok, so I've read the other reviews and not agreeing with most I decided to write my own. First, I can't believe how low of a rating this hotel has received from reviewers on this site. I honestly think what may be happening is that this hotel is a little to hip for certain travelers. 
The W hotel is very nice. The staff is very professional and responsive to requests. At times I've even seen them walking the dogs of hotel guests. The bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. It has very high thread count sheets, a goose down comforter, a feather bed, and goose down pillows. Well I don't know how, but someone on this site managed to complain about that!
The decor is definitely trendy. At all times there is house music playing in the lobby and bar area so if you like that genre then you will be right at home. During the evening they have candles burning and the bar area comes alive with people from all over Seattle. This is why you might want to stay there. To be honest, if I was staying at the Hilton I would probably go to the W just to hang out and mingle. It is definitely a cool spot to meet people. I'd say the age range is early thirties to late forties. 
For the guy complaining about the hotel charging for internet access, most hotels do charge a fee for that service. But if you are truly frugal, and it sounds like you are, then you should have used the FREE internet access in the lobby and bar area. That's what I did because I didn't want to pay either.
The food at the hotel is a little expensive. An omelet delivered was $25 including service charges. Oatmeal costs about $13 delivered. Both were very good but I just couldn't justify the price, especially when there are so many restaurants nearby.
To be sure, if you are more of a conservative person I would recommend you stay at the Hilton or Hyatt. Those hotels are more traditional. I'm actually a Hilton honors diamond member but after staying at the W, I will remain there for the rest of the month while I'm in Seattle.
If you do decide to stay at the W, make sure you check out the great restaurant nearby called Jasmine. The food there is excellent and they also have a very nice vibe in their bar area. 
Anyhow, good luck with your travels.Yes, thanks for asking. We thought the beds were comfortable but the down cover too heavy, had to call for blankets in the middle of the night. Those should be available in the room already, in the closet maybe. Spent a few nights sleepless, fighting with the down pillows, which are normally not good for side sleepers, only for back sleepers. There should be 2 firm pillows on each bed and 2 down pillows, which gives one a choice, thank God. The minibar was locked, very strange since we have been to five star hotels where they were not locked and did not need a key to get in, the hotel should figure out how to do that. The coordination between the front desk people was poor, we asked for 2 days to get an additional room, during our stay there and no one did anything, although promising to, we had to keep on top of it, it was quite disconcerting, no messages, no returned calls to our room...The concierge, a young man, directed us to Anthony's on the water downtown when we asked for a good seafood restaurant within walking distance. That place was pretty bad for a very expensive menu, the view was great but we would never eat there again. The concierge said their food was ""excellent""...wrong! He really should be more informed, or fired. A list should be composed that lists all the best spots in town for food, drinks, dancing, shopping, etc...We had never been to Seattle before, and your information was non-existent!
The delivery waiter of our morning in room service was truly a bomb! He never asked if we wanted the tray in our room or in the hall, he would just rush past into our room where I was lying half asleep or naked, staring at me, yuck! This guy is unbelievable! Then if we would not answer his knock, he would disappear, with our tray, then we would have to call downstairs and get him to come back, then he would try to barge in again, where we had to keep the safety on the door to keep him out! He came with no coffee spoons, 1/2 the order, etc...Then we would have to call again, unbelievable...It seemed as if there was very little overseeing or organization in that kitchen!
Then we actually went to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant one morning and the coffee and juice came but no food. There were only 4 tables seated and it was around 8 AM. We waited and waited and finally the breakfasts came, hardly lukewarm. Eggs and potatoes should not be cold, they taste like grease and rubber. So then we sent the potatoes back and they came back in 10 minutes, after we had finished our eggs already, since we were starving for a few hours already. The kitchen is totally disorganized!
The fact that you charge for an internet connection is truly offending! We are programmers and designers and cannot believe the mind that thought that one up! Needless to say we had not encountered that before in other hotels! And so we did not use that service, although we really wanted to, the principle of it all, unbelievable.
Let us know if any of these things happen, then we might come back!
Sincerely,
The ClaytonsWe stayed at the W on July 29 at the tail end of a Salt Spring Island, Vancouver, Seattle trip and it was a great end to a fabulous trip. 
Minuses - It is decidedly hip - almost painfully so. The music in the lobby along with a busy check in made is almost hard to hear the desk staff. The dark hallways were cool at first, but when I walked past the ice machine room twice because I couldn't see the sign, I felt like a fool. However, the pluses are much greater....
We booked on-line about 4-weeks prior to the stay and got an on-line pre-pay special and got a rate that was close to or lower than many other big-chain hotels. We wanted to check out the hype about the W so booked here. What we got was a room similar to those we have paid much more for in places like Chicago
Service is top-notch from the valet to the baggage staff - everyone worked hard to live up to their ""whatever/whenever"" promise. The Concierge helped us explore the city in our short stay with lots of suggestions for dining and shopping and a suggested walking tour. The W is located very centrally in the city - walking distance to Pikes Market and the Piers.
The room was a corner room with a long entrance hallway that led to a huge (the booking said 430 sq. ft.) corner room that was beautifully appointed. We didn't hear a sound from any other room or the hall but did get a bit of street noise on the 6th floor. A wonderful king-size pillow-top mattress with soft, silky linens piled with 6(!) down pillows (no calls for extra pillows here!) A large work desk similar to a photo in an earlier review. The carpet was a super-soft dark chocolate brown. The honor-bar was stocked with the usual items along with the more unusual like a small travel umbrella (great idea for Seattle), computer cords, postcards and a CD - all at very reasonable prices for an honor bar. 
The room had a great corner view with lots of natural light, a small stereo with a great mix CD and a listing of local radio stations. We stayed as late as possible lounging in the plush robes, taking long showers using the Bliss products (face wash, too!) and snuggling in the comfy bed before check-out at noon.
I would do the W in Seattle or any other city again if I got such a great rate. This is a great concept for a chain and the price was great. Next time maybe we'll go to one within driving distance so we can take our dog because I understand the pet service is outstanding.We had two nights at the W before embarking on an Alaskan cruise. The staff was helpful. Our room was ultra-comfortable. The bed/pillows/linens were the best I've ever encountered outside of my own home. We had a great view of Mt. Rainier out our window. I'm still using the Bliss products they had in the bathroom and plan to order more (a rare find for hotel soap!). I've read a lot of reviews where people complain about the lighting. It is a little dark in the hallways, but we didn't find it to be scary or incapacitating in any way. My recommendation to the W would be to consider backlighting the room numbers somehow....neon maybe?... to keep with the ""cool"" theme and make it easier to find your doorway. All in all we had a great stay and look forward to returning to this hotel and possibly trying some others in the chain.I really do love this hotel and always have. It’s my favorite place to stay in Seattle. I like the Sheraton, have a bit of love-hate with the Westin, but the W is my first choice.
Upgrades: There are only about 8 suites here, half of which are smoking and one of which is ‘accessible’ so there aren’t a lot of suite upgrade opportunities. But a Kool Korner room on a high floor has never been a problem.
When I stayed in May 2005 there was a large conference booked over several days staying at the hotel, and they’d wrapped up a bunch of the small number of suites that the hotel had. Plus Snoop Dogg was staying there. So I was in a Kool Korner room. 
I did notice a few areas of the room where form overtakes function. I didn’t have enough drawers. 1/3 of the chest is taken up by the safe and it’s only about half the size of the usual hotel chest. (Regular rooms seem to have more chest space, oddly enough.)
Our first night at the hotel we had dinner at the hotel’s restaurant, Earth & Ocean. It’s much improved over two years ago. The chef is very creative with presentation and they offer very high quality meat and fish. The sweetbreads were a nice size with no sinew whatsoever. Despite the food, though, it’s not a great restaurant, at least it wasn’t on this occasion. Service lacked. Several times they dropped silverware by the table. I cringed when someone in the party asked for a Miller Lite and the waiter said “I don’t think so. But I’ll check.” with a roll of the eyes. He never returned to the subject (such as to followup and apologize for not having the first choice, and perhaps offer a suggested alternative).
Ordered room service breakfast around 6:30, it arrived in 14 minutes. I had an excellent avocado, bacon, and cheese omellette. Truly delicious. The food at the W, from the restaurant to room service to banquet, is good across the board.
For folks who haven’t been there, it’s a typical W: lighting is dark, ‘hip’ music plays in the lobby. There’s a funky ‘living room’ in the lobby to relax in. The bar scene is trendy. Rooms are comfortable. The hotel aspires to be high-end in service, touting its ‘Wherever/Whenever” line (they’ll handle any need you have) but this is no Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton. Hotel employees are mostly attractive twenty-somethings dressed in black, and not as well-trained in service as are staff at the high-end chains. If you want refined service, stay across the street at the Fairmont. The W is funky, fun, and for me comfortable.
It’s sometimes surprisingly inexpensive. TravelZoo sometimes promotes great deals, I’ve seen it for as little as $139 there. It occasionally participates in Starwood’s cash & points award program, which this year means 4000 Starwood points and $60 for a night. But without deals it can run $230 or more, even $289. I’m not sure it’s worth twice the price of the nearby Sheraton.I was excited to bring my wife to the W in Seattle as I thought it would be a perfect get-away from which to explore the downtown area. My head has been on a Westin pillow many a night - but this was my first chance to ""experience"" the W effect.
We arrived in a downpour but that's ok. One's pupils need not dilate in the W reception area....dark, dark, dark. At 2:00 p.m., all you see are candles and the reflection of the computer screens off the faces of the staff. Hmmm, interesting, I thought. Friendly folks - great ""welcome"" by the guys at the door, and in no time we were up to our room. I was ready for dark hallways, having read other reviews, but these are REALLY dark. Wow. Interesting. I kinda like it to be honest with you.
Room - they call it ""spectacular"" but I might call it peculiar. Not very large by any stretch, a cool sofa in the window, some IKEA-looking furniture and there you have it. Did we feel a warmth from the room? No. Was the bed ""heavenly?"" Not if you compare it to the Westin down the road...
Overall, the W is a cool place. Yuppies will love it. Techno freaks will love it. I wouldn't bring my kids, or if you are over 50 and want something a bit ""classy"", there are better choices. Lots better choices. 
Kudos to the concierge - always on top of things, went the extra mile and did it with a smile. Well done.My wife an I were recent guests at the W Seattle. This hotel promises and hypes a zen-like experience; however, it falls short in delivery. The hot water faucet fell off it's spindle at the first touch; we left the hotel at 9:00 a.m., returning at 3:15 p.m. to find that the room had not been made up. There is no door tag to request room cleaning, only a do not disturb tag. The lighting throughout is gloomy, and the lobby/bar area is quite unbelievably noisy in the evenings, since there are no soft furnishings to absorb conversation sound - certainly no place for a quiet drink after a long day. Restaurant prices are high, ($17 for a continental breakfast), and the final sting in the tail was a charge of $30 per night for parking. There are better places to stay in Seattle for less money than this.Positives: The beds were large and absolutely fantastic to sleep in. Along with the big pillows, I was tempted not to go home.....The staff was courteious and extremely helpful....Nice decor with the lights set at a intimate setting....Great location to walk around downtown and close to Pike St Market
Negatives: I don't mind when the rooms are chilly, but I did notice the AC was on full blast...The biggest pain was probably the parking. Not a big area to pull up the car for valet, so found myself waiting in the street for the person in front of me plus a few cars coming out
Overall a good hotel and would recommend staying thereThe service was OK, but for the price I expect a view. There was no view, the room was freezing (couldn't turn the heat up!) and it smelled of cigarettes very strongly even though they said it was a non-smoking room, and they refused to move me. Plus it's way out by the university and not close to anything! better to stay at a hotel down by the market. And the booking agent said taxes were included but they wanted another $150 when I got there for some new city taxes! Whatever...The hotel is in a very convenient part of town, just behind the Fairmont Olympic. It's a few blocks to Pike Place market and to the downtown core. I was upgraded when I checked in (I'm a Starwood Gold) which was great because I stayed here only due to some free promo nights I received that were about to expire.
The rooms are not large but they have their version of the ""Heavenly Bed"". All the room furnishings look great and even their stationary was impressive. The bathroom accessories are Bliss, which is supposed to be a boutique brand. The hallways are downright dark but I realize that's the nature of the hotel so I accept it. One thing that got on my nerves is the elevator ""ding"". It's very loud & I could hear it although I was in a corner room about as far away from the elevator as you could get.
The W is a new hotel & that's why I chose it. The surrounding hotels are very old. I didn't eat here but the lounge and restaurant looked ""cool"". One BIG issue that I had was the valet parking. When you park, you're not allowed to self-park. Upon receiving my car when I was checking out, there was a large scratch. Ok, I filled out the claim form but I was visibly upset. The valet people kept telling me it would be ok, they'll take responsibility, and for me to ""go home"" and wait for their call. Well, I think it was just to get me out of their hair because I received a call a few days later from them disowning all responsibility. To make a long story short, I e-mailed the GM and Starwood HQ of the problem and they fixed it immediately.
Not many hotels go that extra mile but the W certainly did!I need to give this hotel a good rating because it was clean, attractive and convenient. However, it wasn't for us. It was a little to ""cold"" and I don't mean the temperature. With exception of the valet guys, who were very friendly, everyone else acted as if they were doing us a favor by being there. We prefer a little warmer and cozy setting so we won't be back. Now the Willows Lodge...that is a great place!!!!!Despite having made a reservation for a non-smoking King, I got stuck in a Double Room overlooking loud external air vents and near the elevator. To top it all off, my next door neighbor turned up his bass to party at midnight. Hotel staff wasn't especially responsive with regard to giving me a quiet room. So much for being a Starwood Preferred Guest and paying over $300 a night. I'll remember to stay elsewhere next time I'm in Seattle.I stay at the W Seattle on a regular basis and overall I would say the experience is above average and the service is consistent. My only criticism is the menu in the restaurant is extremely limited, and the room service menu isn't much better.
Other than that, no complaints.This hotel is directly across the street from my office. I toured it shortly after its opening, and thought I'd stay someday as an in-city treat. What a mistake. 
I purchased the room at a charity auction. It was packaged with two tickets to the Seattle Symphony, and sold as ""attend the symphony and then stay at the W."" When I got home and opened the envelope I purchased, I found that the symphony tickets were for Thursday performances; the W Hotel stay was for any Friday or Saturday night. At first I thought it was a mix-up by the charity, and frankly, it was for charity and I didn't really care. But after my experience with the arrogant, sloppy and just horrifically bad service at the W, I now wonder if the mistake was theirs.
When I realized the room and tickets were incompatible, I decided to use the room as a surprise for the BF. I procured theatre tickets to a sold out show, and called the W to make a reservation. After being on hold for at least 10 minutes while the operator tried to ""figure it out,"" I was sent to the 800 number. The 800 operator was not exactly rude, but disinterested, uninformed, and generally oozed negative attitude. She, too, couldn't ""figure it out,"" and it literally took over 1/2 hour to make the reservation.
When I made the reservation, I also told the operator that I wanted a corner room with a view and would pay whatever it took to upgrade to it. She assured me that I would have a corner room on a high floor with a view, and even after I offered THREE TIMES to pay for an upgrade, she told me (coldly and condescendingly (difficult to articulate)) that it would not be necessary and that I would get my request.
You can see where this is going. When we arrived for check in, they gave us a corner room on the 5th floor in the back of the building, facing the wall of the Four Season's garage across an alley. When I spoke to the disinterested ""I'm too cool for my job"" desk clerk, the best I could get was a regular room on a somewhat higher floor, also in the back of the building, this time overlooking the same garage by about 10 feet. No apology, no real help, and attitude. By the way -- when I presented the 'bearer certificate' that I discussed with the reservation department for over 30 minutes earlier in the day, ""Mr. Hip"" had no idea what to do, called over an apparently more experienced version of himself, and the two of them took 20 minutes to, you guessed it, ""figure it out.""
Trying to keep a positive outlook, the BF and I decided to go to Earth and Ocean, the hotel restaurant. It was a busy Saturday night. We stood in a highly trafficked area and were ignored until I was able to stop the ""greeter,"" who told me they were no longer serving in the dining room, but we could order from a bar menu at the bar. Then he walked away. I mean, literally -- just walked away without additional comment, leaving us to figure out if we should seat ourselves, wait for someone else, or move into the lounge area. After a moment, we were able to stop another staff member who handed us two sticky bar menus while we were still standing in that odd, highly trafficked area, and I swear -- he, too, just walked away without comment. 
We left and went to a bistro down the street.
The room was okay, albeit dark and facing the roof deck of the garage across the alley; the bathroom was dirty and well below five star standards.
We left the next morning, and the portfolio read ""zero balance."" While I was very disappointed with the attitude and service of the staff from beginning to end, thought the room was substandard, and had paid several hundred dollars for a ""package"" that was not a ""package,"" I thought I'd just let it go and remember that at least the charity made out well.
Then, of course, I get my credit card bill. Yep, you guessed it. They charged me for the privilege of being ignored, condescended to, spending (between the two operators) over forty-five minutes to even make a reservation, and placing me in a substandard room with a dirty bathroom. 
I called them to correct the latest mistake in a series of mistakes, and after explaining the situation to someone in their reservation department, was forwarded to the guest services manager. I can't articulate the attitude well at all -- but at least it's consistent. Disinterested and arrogant is the best way to describe it. He told me that he would ""look into it,"" and call me back. Two days later I got a voicemail from him asking for the charity I purchased the room from, because he couldn't find the certificate. At this point, I was furious and didn't immediately return the call. About an hour later, he called again and told me he found the certificate and would be refunding the $230.00 charge to my card. The entire conversation took less than 30 seconds, and ended with a curt, perfunctory and insincere apology. Period.
Wow... Just unbelievable. I don't see why anyone would want to stay here. The rooms are average at best, the bathroom was dirty, and the service was just ""too hip"" and arrogant to be anything but worthless. 
The location is good, poised strategically between the financial and retail districts downtown, but so are several other very fine hotels. If you come to Seattle, stay in the area, but don't stay at this facility. I can't imagine anyplace that would reflect more poorly on our city.Stayed at the W Seattle with my fiance in April 2005.
We really liked it. In fact, I can't think of any negatives!
We booked the room online at the Starwood website and got a GREAT deal...far less expensive than one usually pays to stay at a W Hotel. 
The entire hotel is very stylish and fun. Our room was spacious and had a great view of the city. The linens & towels were great--soft, good quality. The bed was also really comfy. 
The only glitch that I can speak of occurred on our first night. We hung out in the bar and ordered an appetizer to snack on. Something in the kitchen got screwed up and our order (which was pretty simple) ended up taking over 30 mins to get to us. The bar staff was really apologetic about it. Later, we ordered a dessert to share--same story, kitchen problems. Long story short, the staff were very kind and seemed really embarassed about it. They comped us both the app and the dessert. We left the bar pretty happy and left the bartenders a good tip.
I would definately recommend the W for anyone who wants to stay someplace fun and different that has a good vibe and great style.I had my first W experience in Seattle and I'm converted. The W is all about creating a mood - you'll either love it, or you won't. The moment you step into the lobby you're enveloped by the aroma of vanilla candles and the sound of chilled-out beats. The lighting is very subdued to the point of being a little too dark - which may add to the club vibe in the lobby, but is a definite security concern on the guest floors. The rooms are very comfortable, decorated in an elegant 1940's style - bathed in browns, dark wood accents, window blinds, and a sofa in the window alcove. The bathroom amenities by Bliss are deluxe!
The in-house restaurant, Earth & Ocean, is excellent. It focusses on regional dishes & wines - try the seasonal prixe fixe menu accompanied by a wine flight for a culinary education in the delights of the Pacific Northwest. 
My only criticism is that the front desk staff could be more service-oriented - the W style may be cool, but they should be warmer.The W was awsome!!! Great Service a great staff. The mood of the hotel was great. After staying in the terrible Warwick this was an awsome suprise.
Very Expensive but definatly worth the price if you want quality.We stayed at this hotel with my starwood points for 1 night in September 2004. WE LOVED IT! I can't be sure if our room was typical, but we had what I considered to be a fairly spacious, corner room with wall-to-wall windows (which had ample covering to shut out the light for sleep), and great amenities. We had a view over the city, and the location was good, though we didn't spend much time in the immediate environs...
The staff were typical W staff, with slightly cooler demeanors, but certainly not rude or stuffy. Notably, the bellman was very helpful with our loads of luggage (we stayed just 1 night, but were completing a week long trip)! 
Next trip to Seattle, I will definitely try to stay at the W!This is a great hotel for business or leisure. We stayed at this hotel in November of 2004. Great location - it was a nice walk to the the Seattle Museum of Art, the downtown shopping district, Pioneer Square, and even the Seahawks football stadium. Quick taxi ride to the Space Needle and Experience Music Project.
The staff was great - wonderful concierge staff. We got great dinner reservations to Wild Ginger (read NOT WAIT LIST) - beautiful corner room with GREAT AMENITIES! Very cool lobby at night they even serve drinks from the cool bar.
I would enthusiastically recommend this hotel to anyone unless you are traveling on budget. I personally liked the lighting but everyone is different so please note: hallways are DARK (mood lighting) as well as the lobby.I've stayed at the W Seattle a few times, and have found that its a matter of style over substance. Yes, its a very ""cool"" place: most of the staff look like secret service agents with the earpiece and wire; the Bliss soap and shampoo products are trendy, and the beds are wonderful. 
That said, there is a sense that the hotel has already fallen on hard times. Housekeeping is consistantly poor considering the hotels' class and price (mold/mildew in the shower in all three rooms Ive been in; debris and garbage from previous occupants not cleaned away; used towel still hanging on the bathroom door hook). 
They have recently removed the coffee makers from all the rooms. They said you can get a free cup in the lobby bar in the morning (which when I did was a thermos of lukewarm old coffee). Room service prices are absurd, and the high speed internet access is $15 a day. For business folks, the chair at the desk in the room is far too low (a pretty basic faux pas at a ""business hotel"") and you end up having to put several pillows underneath you to put you at a level where you can work comfortably. 
The W chain tries way too hard but fails to deliver on the basics. For the money, there are better choices, although I guess if seeing people like Bono and the New York Yankees in the hotel bar is a draw, this is a good place.I stayed in a corner room with a great view of the city, I liked everything about my room. However, I advise that you don't take the corner rooms -- because of the noise produced by the traffic around the building is just too much that I didn't sleep well...I recently was in the Seattle area for a combination business and pleasure trip. For the business part I opted for a great deal for one night at the W as it is near where I needed to be. To say the hotel is understated is an understatement. Yes, it is chic and slick feeling but the aim is clearly for twentysomething to thirtysomething hipsters. There was not a time when I walked through the lobby (pardon me, lounge) when there were not one or several people busily engrossed with their laptops. I guess being seen yakking away on a cell phone has become passe and now you must be seen with your laptop to be considered fashionably hip. Of course there was always new age or soft jazz music along with subdued lighting to keep the hipsters comfortable.
The room was also decorated in a hip understated way and was actually very comfortable--especially the bed and pillows. But navigating down the darkened hallways to find your room can be a challenge. 
After coming back in the evening after dining at a nearby restaurant, I thought perhaps the hotel had not paid their electric bill as the lobby (pardon me, lounge) area was lit almost entirely by dim candlelight. Of course the glows from the laptops helped a bit.
To be honest, the service was very good and not intrusive. But the overall experience at the W just seemed like I was living in a cliche.Hotel is in a central location which makes it easy to see all of downtown on foot. Swanky, stylish lobby was refreshing. Rooms were fine, but as this was a splurge I found it a bit too business like than as stylish as their lobby. Also, only valet parking was available which meant a charge of $31 a nice, + tips for parking! For a 4 star hotel, the bathroom was dirty and the shower stall full of mould, mildew and softening drywall. That's unacceptable for a hotel of that rate and star class. Other than that disappointment I would say its a fine hotel, but if its more than you usually would spend, I would go elsewhere.this is a fun and fabulous hotel! huge rooms (i had a corner room with great ceiling-to-floor windows and a chaise lounge), clean to the point of immaculate, huge bathroom with great tub, excellent food, great room service and housekeeping, excellent location!!! one touch i loved is that my sheets always smelled like they had been dried on a clothesline! :) i highly rec. this great hotel! :)Stayed at the W Hotel Seattle for 2 nights. It was a great experience and definitely not what I had expected. 
When I first stepped into the lobby I felt like I was in a lounge/bar! The lobby was dark and dimly lit with scented candles. The hallways were also dimly lit--But so what! They don't call it the W Hotel for nothing.
The rooms were very contemporary and immaculate. Room service and valet was a bit pricey. Staff was friendly and helpful.
Overall I would definitely stay at the W Hotel all over again.We stayed at the W in Seattle for 2 nights of our honeymoon. The decor of the hotel, lobby and rooms, was very cool - different than the ususal hotel. We were able to easily walk to Pike Place market and Pioneer square from the hotel. Room service was very $$$ and not very good. I didn't compare parking prices but I think $29 a day is a bit much too!What a wonderfully different hotel.
As a 4-star hotel it was top-notch. Very sleek and modern, and yet extremely comfortable. Rooms were very cool with plasma TV on the wall.
Only down side was the lack of coffee making facilities in the room, although the Seattle Coffee Co was only two doors down (or the dreadful Starbucks across the road).
The W will definitely be my choice of hotel if I ever return to SeattleWhile the room itself was pretty nice, with a good view and an alcove couch, I was not impressed by the rest of the hotel. I spent two weeks emailing back and forth with the ""whatever whenever"" service at the W Seattle to try to arrange for a special fantasy camping surprise for my fiance who loves to camp. We finally came up with s'mores, which the woman from the ""whatever whenever"" service told me the kitchen could definitely do. She priced it out for me, and I okayed it and asked for it at 10 PM, when we were due to arrive. It was not ready for us, and the man at the front desk told me that it could be done the next day at 3 PM. We rushed back to our room the next day to make it there by 3 PM, but no s'mores. I called the front desk to ask what happened. Apparently, no one went out to get the ""materials"" and I was asked if I could wait another 45 minutes to an hour. We had dinner reservations with friends whom we had not seen in quite some time, so I had to say no. Nothing was offered to compensate for this fiasco, not even a sincere apology. I was asked if the manager could call me, and I said that would be fine. The manager never called me. Only when I complained the following day at check out was anything done. I was given two tickets for free drinks at the W Bar and told not to spend over $15 dollars per drink! This was all extremely rude. I have never had a problem in another hotel like this. Friends of mine who have had problems at hotels have received more of a concerned response from staff and management. This hotel definitely did not have five-star service!This hotel was best described by a woman who rode up the elevator with me on day two of my 7-day stay at the W; ""...I am as hip as the next person, but I need some LIGHT...""
This re-done hotel - tucked behind the historic Fairmont Olympic Hotel Seattle on 4th St - is hip. But if you have trouble seeing, bring a flashlight! Elevators have dark carpet and two tiny pendant lights - and those elevators are FAST, so be ready to jump on and jump off! Lobby is two-level and lighted by tea-lights.
Great sleeping room (choose the upgrade, if you can - it is worth it!) with wide screen, flat-panel TVs. Great shiny bathrooms, good office space and comfy couch. Prompt room service, which is good because the ""honor bar"" is really expensive. Not much of a RS selection, but that's okay, because there are plenty of wonderful places to eat in walking distance (like Schuckers - next door!). Coffee lovers dream (Starbucks, SEattle's Best and Tully's all very close!) Short walk downhill to shopping... Long walk uphill with purchases!
One big downer - no pool!The W is always a great stay! Have stayed here several times and am still overwhelmed by the hospitality, helpful staff, and amazing hotel rooms. Front desk was very helpful at recommending late night dining. Earth & Ocean bar is beautiful and the drinks are well worth it! Bliss bath products add a great touch!This was my first stay at a W property. Contrary to what is written on here--at least by some--I found the W Seattle to be just what I was looking for. As a volunteer coordinator for a group, I was able to negotiate a rate of $136/ night (for 11 rooms). The rooms were immaculate and as advertised, well-equipped. While it's true that the hallways are dimly lit (with difused blue lighting), that's the point! The W Seattle is a funky Seattle property right in the heart of downtown and within easy walking distance to Pike Market and other attractions. If you're looking for bright lights, go to a Holiday Inn or Motel 6. (You'll be sure to get a light of hallway lighting there albeit flourescent!). The staff was very friendly and warmly welcomed my group. We used the Strategy Room which had a nice Boardroom-type setting with a fixed table and built-in audio visual equiptment. I ordered in a continental breakfast for thr group consisting of bagels and cream cheese (average); Starbucks Coffee (always good) and the W's own homemade granola bars (AWESOME!) My only complaint was that the meeting room itself had no windows. I'm one of those persons who likes to see natural light. They do have meeting rooms with windows but they are your standard ballroom types with folding walls to compartmentalize the groups meeting. I was going for a more ""fixed"" boardroom. What can you do? That's the way the architect planned it. The lobby is tastefully done and the reception desk is lit by a row of flickering tea lights/candles. Again, not commercially illuminated but that's the point! Something different and unique. I would go back to this establishment--without hesitation. Actually, now I am very curious about other W properties located throughout the country.Spent four days at the “W” over ’04 Labor-Day weekend. It’s not the usual big-city hotel. It belongs to the same chain that runs Westin and Sheraton, but has a totally different look and feel. 
THE LOGISTICS: Check-in and main floor is compact and six steps above the living-room sitting area and adjacent bar and restaurant. I don’t think you can get to the lower level except walking down the stairs, or walking outside around the corner and coming in the lower entrance. Staff is efficient, bar serves good drinks – although the seating area was small and the music was a bit loud for the space. This hotel will not appeal to everyone. Typical guests seemed around mid 30’s and 40’s and the type of music heard in the lobby/bar is age- appropriate – no Musak for sure. The corridors to the rooms are indeed dimly lit but have interesting pictures and lighting. I loved it. Indoor pool and exercise room privileges at the Sheraton five blocks away. I didn’t eat in the hotel One night opted to eat at the casual Shucker’s Restaurant across the street where price and value were a good match and service was excellent. 
THE LOCATION: The W’s downtown location is great. Walking, buses, trolleys and cabs got us all over Seattle with ease. 
THE ROOM: Our room had two firm beds with down mattress pads, tons of great pillows and expensive sheets and a nice long couch for lounging. Our 4th floor view wasn’t anything, but the windows (hidden by wooden shutters) opened. That’s a real plus. Bathroom was spacious with plenty of towels and Aveda products. The main closet was split with dresser drawers and shelves in the middle. 
ON THE DOWNSIDE: The W’s HVAC air-vent noise was annoying – a definite hiss while air circulates. But it’s like white noise and after awhile you may not notice it. 
CELEBRITY WATCHING: Robin Williams was staying there and some musicians in town for a concert. From what others have said, the W is often the choice of celebrities.Just returned from a long weekend trip to the W Hotel and thought it was fabulous. It is very modern and the halls are too dark but the room was wonderful, the W bed was the best I have ever slept in, service was great, very friendly and helpful. The location is perfect, walking distance to everything. Highly recommend this hotel.I travel frequently for business and spend a lot of my time in hotels; this was one of the better experiences I have had in a while.
If you like staying at a budget hotel or don’t mind mediocre then this probably isn't the place for you.
If you want to stay in an ultra-sheik and trendy hotel, like mood lit hallways and aren't too concerned that everything, including the mini-bar water is designer labelled (lovely bottles though!) then this is defiantly the place to stay.
I -will- stay here again when back in Seattle.We checked in at the W to find that one of our adjoining rooms was not quite ready yet. We felt that was fine since we were able to use one room to get ready in for dinner out. When we arrived back at the hotel after dinner they said the adjoining room was not going to be available and so four of us were all crammed into one king bed room. One had to sleep on the little sofa and one on a rollaway. The lack of compassion by the front desk was unbelievable. 
Room service Sunday morning took 1 1/2 hours to arrive and obviously had been left sitting for quite some time. Retriving our bags from storage was also an incredibly long wait. Never again.I had heard about the coolness of the W hotel so I was looking forward to it, being more used to Seattle's Marriott in the suburbs. 
Well, the W does look good, particularly the lobby and restaurant, there is definitively an atmosphere. 
But, as it happens often with ""trendy"" hotel; it's more window dressing than actual value.
the W is basically a 1930's revamped hotel where they renovated the basic rooms with a few cool looking pieces of furniture/colour scheme but the air conditioning is still super loud, you can hear whatever happens in the corridor from the bed and the neighbours. The bed is not particularly comfortable and the wide screen LCD TV, a good idea in itself, is positioned at an awkward angle (ie on the wall opposite the bed but not in front but more to one side). 
Being cool, all practical & boring infos about the hotel (such as internet rates, check out times etc...) are hard to find in their little paint palette like booklet. If you want internet, you basically have to have an ethernet cable as no wifi is available (low tech hey). 
And that cable is not in the room of course, given the exhorbitant prices of everything, I gave up without even asking...
The in house DVD collection sounded cool as well (and free, an event here) but unfortunately, maybe it was bad luck, but the DVD was worn out and freezing every 30 secs so also gave up. 
The biggest letdown was the room service. The restaurant has a very good reputation locally but room service is 1/ daylight robbery 2/ food is so so. 46$ for a minuscule chicken sandwich and asparagus food is crazy :
So, all in all, this was not a good experience and I will certainly not return if I have a choice. FYI I stayed 2 nights.Stayed here in Feb 2007 for two nights. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. Tasteful modern interior design, flat screen TV; all very nice. The hallways were a little too dark...but I see where they were going with the idea! :)
I was however rather disappointed with the room service. My dinner arrived on the cold side and didn't seem very fresh. 
I'd stay here again in a heartbeat; but I'll definitely be spending my food dollar elsewhere.I was in W hotel in August 12-15,2004. I arrived at 11:30am, but was told I couldn't check in till 3pm. So, with no choice, I have to open up my suitcase IN THE LOBBY to take out things I will need to do some city walking and take pictures. They had my suitcase placed in a storage in the meantime. I came back at 7pm that night to check in. The front desk girl asked for my credit card, which I did. Then she asked for an ID picture. I told her it is in my suitcase, which is in the storage. She told me she need to see it. I told her that I am NOT going to open up my suitcase IN THE LOBBY for the second time, as it is very humiliating. The hotel manager said the same thing (we need your ID) and couldn't offer another alternative, even when I suggested that they take me to one room with my suitcase where I can open it privately. All he can ofer are apologies. Finally another front desk girl suggested they check me in and then another staff will take me to my room with the suitcase then be able to take my ID picture out to show. I agreed to this.
This only shows you that even if a hotel is supposed to be cool, the front desk and more so the hotel manager WASN'T. I told the staff and the hotel manager that we are coming in that day as a big group of 70-80 people, and that this incident will not pass unnoticed to the management and coordinating people, so that they will think 10 times or more before they decide to book a W hotel again in the future for a meeting.We just stayed at the W hotel Seattle.Bad news.Dark lobby is suppose to be cool.Dark hallways are suppose to be cool.Is poor sevice suppose to be cool also? Room service is a joke! Wrong food . Cold food. Housekeeping @3:30. Concierge services non existent. But if you think that candles in a lobby and designer clothes on a young staff is what a hotel is all about, by all means try the WWe stayed at the W in Seattle the first weekend of August, 2004 and it was wonderful. We enjoyed the decor, food and superb service. Our 14 year old thought it was the best ever and wants to return. Finally a hotel with wonderful beds - they definitely have the comfort level turned to max. My compliments to the designer.My husband and I booked a room at the W despite reading the mixed reviews on this site first. We wanted something ""different"" for a rare child free getaway to the big city. Our room was a 350 sq ft suite on the 18th floor (tried for a corner king but non were available). We really enjoyed the room; great bed, linens, and the window seat overlooking the city had plenty of room for both of us to stretch out with the Sunday paper. The location allowed us to walk everywhere we wanted to go in the city. We were able to laugh about the hotel staff. The physical surroundings are sophisticated but the staff isn’t. Hey folks it’s OK to kiss up to the guests, we’ll still respect you in the morning. We asked one of the hotel staff to suggest a place for breakfast, he gave us the names and locations of two places which both turned out to be closed Sunday mornings. However, when we asked for a late check out we were very graciously granted it. We enjoyed our stay at the W and recommend it to others looking for an urban experience.I found this hotel lacking in many departments. the worst concierge service i have ever experienced, and we used several of the concierges there. very small room with zero storage. i am a fan of the minimalist mid century modern style and was unimpressed by the decor. minimalism can be acheived while still providing storage folks! 3 days for laundry service and they forgot to deliver items back to us, unacceptable! gym is simply a small guest room with about six pieces of equipment, decidedly not hip. bad service at front desk, concierge and bar. room not as described. the good stuff: the restaurant is to die for but bring lots of $$$. the location is excellent, right in the middle of downtown. the drinks are fabulous if you can survive the hour long wait for one and handle the high price. the valets and room service people were the nicest employees there.those dark hallways were great, keeps everyone quiet, we never saw or heard a soul in the hallways. my suspicion is that very few of the people we saw packed downstairs in the bar/lobby area were actually staying at the hotel. i got the message. i will not stay here again, but i will visit the restaurant and bar. the fairmont olympic is right next door, think i'll try it next time.Just returned from a 5 night stay at the W Seattle and really enjoyed my time there. Like all W Hotels, the lobby decor is trendy, dark, and moody. Our room was large, with nice city views, a,super-comfy bed, and a big bathroom stocked with fabulous Bliss products (the best part about staying in a W Hotel if you ask me!). There were some really nice features of the hotel, like the cozy lobby with big fireplace, free hot chocolate, a tiny gym, and a great bar. This hotel is also well-located, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square, and literally next door to shopping. Service was friendly and helpful.
My only complaint was the exorbitantly high cost of extras--including the internet, valet parking, and food. There was free Wi-Fi in the lobby, but this is less than ideal for business travellers. Overall, though, I really enjoyed the W and would stay there if I find myself in Seattle in the future.Stayed with friends in two rooms for a fun weekend. Trendy hotel with the standard ""W"" look. Rooms are a little bit on the small side - particularly considering the prices you are paying - but that's pretty standard for all the W hotels I have stayed at. Most everything is a bit on the pricey side.
Hotel help was very friendly and helpful all the way around (front desk, bellhops, bar/restaurant). Terrific location in Downtown Seattle. A very reasonable walk up to the shopping areas, down to the stadiums, or over to Pike's Market - very centrally location.
Beds are very comfortable, and room were very clean and has all the standard ""W"" upscale comforts (LCD TV, Stereo, well stock mini bar.) Nice modern decor.
In short, nice hotel with good hotel amenities - but you aren't going to be spending a lot of time in the room and taking advantage of them - there are more reasonably priced options for hotels in the area.Stayed here for 2 nights to attend a wedding. Although the ambience and style was nice for the wedding and reception and exactly what the bride wanted, I was not pleased with other services. Hotel was dark, guess that caters to the hip and trendy crowd.The cost of parking and drinks was ridiculous. Parking was twice the amount I paid even in Hawaii at an upscale hotel . 
Be careful if you have a promo code for discounted rooms, they did not work for us.
I must say that the beds are comfortable as well as the pillows. On that note, be aware that they allow animals here. My son received numerous bites the first night. We were on the 14th floor but did not have a view as such, as we were on the north side of the hotel. Housekeeping discarded items that were not to be discarded even thou they were with the tux rental bags left on the bed. I agree with the other reviewer, eat breakfast at the Pike Place Market or even McDonalds at Westlake Center if your watching your pennies. But then again staying at The ""W"" is NOT watching your pennies. If I ever have to stay in Seattle again, I will not be choosing The ""W"".Wow! What a Wonderfully Wild, Whimsical W hotel.
Though I live in British Columbia, this was my first time that I have hopped across the border to hang out and stay in Seattle. This was also my first time staying at a W Hotel.
After reading reviews on this hotel, I was skeptical as to whether or not the service and ambience of this hotel would render a pleasant stay or not. My skepticisms, however, were put to rest shortly after arrival at the W.
I booked a 'Wonderful Room' (i.e. basic room) at the W for 2 nights in mid-February '07. Here's an overview of my stay:
Pro's:
-Service: Speedy & Friendly. Staff aimed to please. Upon check-in, I received a complimentary room upgrade! I was even given a complimentary toothbrush/tube of toothpaste when I informed the front desk that I had forgotten mine at home.
-Ambience: Everything at this hotel is modern and very cool. There was a DJ playing in the lobby Saturday night!
-Rooms: Functional and Beautiful. Comfy beds and nice sized LCD TV. Housekeeping also supplied new toiletries/towels etc. each morning!
-Location: No need for a car or anything! Everything in downtown Seattle worth doing is in walking distance.
Con's:
-Pricing: The room is worth the price if you have a view or get some sort of discount. Room service and amenities, however, like most hotels of this calibre, are outrageously overpriced.
-Bathroom: Cool sink! Great toiletries! But the tub is very average and drab.
-Hallways: Woulden't hurt if they were brighter.
-Restaurant Servers: 50/50. Staff are attentive and efficient, but not always warm and inviting.
Overall:
From check-in to check-out, I had a great experience at the W Seattle. The hotel is not exactly cheap and it is not without its shortfalls, but it should not be overlooked when booking a room in this gorgeous city!We stayed at the W for a few nights in July. While the location was pretty central and the bar scene was fun, we has a few negative experiences that would dissuade me from returning. First, the staff was snooty and unhelpful. Whether it was dinner suggestions or directions, they were of little help and did not want to lift a finger for us. Another major drawback was the service. Other than the fact that the televisions were broken, the room was not serviced by housekeeping on more than one occasion. We had to keep calling housekeeping to get them to clean the room, and when they did, they would not provide new toiletrees or enough towels. Additionally, the bathrooms need a lot of remodeling - it was very old and uninviting. The bar at the hotel is certainly trendy and fun, but I would stay at the Fairmont in the future. Same location, same cost and much, much nicer.The hotel looks exactly like the pictures on the web...stylish, modern decor. I didn't find the halls as dark as other reviewers seemed to think...I did find the bed VERY comfortable, and the room clean & modern. It did seem to be a hangout spot for the 25-35 crowd for drinks. The front desk staff was knowledgeable and efficient. Our remote control was broken, but replaced quickly. I would go back again & stay again at the W.I stayed here in December 2006 whilst on a business trip from the UK. We had a corporate rate for the hotel, so I'd like to say before I start that I thought the room was good value for money.
We arrived late after a hellish internal flight to find the hotel in party mode. There was obviously a fancy Christmas ball gown party happening. First initial thoughts were wow - this is dark and surreal! Checked in with no problems although it was hard to hear the receptionist because of the loud music! Chucked the bags in the room and grabbed a quick drink. Took ages to get served because of the party... but hey. 
We soon went back to the room and it was clean, fresh and comfortable. I had a sofa along my main window so I could peer out into Seattle's great views. The bed, like others have said, is really comfortable and the TV impressive. The bathroom was well equipped and the toiletries were very nice too.
We ate every morning in the hotel for breakfast. This was a hit and miss affair as sometimes it would be perfect and other times the service would let it down. I had lunch one day (Corn Tortillas) and it was probably the worse tasting meal I had all week - never mind! Drinks were steep as were food prices for dinner etc. We used the wireless internet access (which is free on floors 1 > 3) and it was quick and easy.
The hotel was overpriced for water and the mini bar. You even had a menu in your room to purchase bits like bath robes, towels etc, all which were stupidly expensive.
Overall I really liked it here - the only thing that let it down for me was the price for necessities such as water and the parties were a bit too much sometimes – it was nice to have some different people in the hotel ( but some were just plain rude!)
Would be back if we get a good room rate again...I don't have tons to say about this hotel, as we were there for only 12 hours or so... but we loved everything we saw.
the hotel is very beautiful and chic. decor is top notch. and the staff are exceedingly helpful and friendly.
the room we stayed in was a large corner suite with a view of the city and partial view of the water. 
the bed was one of the nicest i've ever slept in, complete with a pillow menu.
really nice spa quality shampoo, conditioner, lotion and face wash in the bathrooms.
the only ""issues"" we encountered was our room being a bit delayed for check in. we were sent to the hotel bar with a $25 gift certificate to kill the time. very nice gesture, however the bar is VERY expensive, so that only bought two drinks. the next day when we checked out, they comp'd our valet parking as well for our inconvenience. that was great since valet was $32 a day (yikes)
we would for sure stay here again, but it's not for people watching their pennies. it's a splurge, but worth it for a nice night away.I stayed at W Seattle Hotel for two days. Room was reserved by a company I was invited by to Seattle for consultation. I personally would have never reserved a room in a pretentiously trendy place like this. I arrived at the hotel around midnight and was confused to see a bunch of drunken naval officers and sailors at the bar, that is basically right in front of the main entrance and greets you when you come in. I thought I got the wrong address as to me it seemed to be a night club. The actual reception was way above on the second floor that you cannot see from the front entrance. I gave another round in my car around the building to confirm that it was the right address. Only after I spoke to a parking valet, I realized that I got to the right place. Which brings me to parking. If you arrive by your own car be prepared to pay $30/day for parking, as there is no place to park your car.
Everything was overpriced. No soda machine was on my floor. I was hungry and had a candy bar, a 12 oz can of cola and a small 12 oz bottle of water from a mini bar- that run me up to $14. When I asked for itemized bill for mini bar charges - I was given simple but firm ""No"" answer. So if you intend to use mini bar keep a tally, otherwise you might get charged for God knows what.
The whole atmosphere of the hotel is that of a vampire castle. Everything is kept dark and dim with only ""mystery"" blue lamps to light up the way.
The room itself was neither comfortable nor particularly clean. 
Bed smelled funny. Total price for a corner room with a view of an adjacent building's wall - $150 per day.
So, decide for yourself. I am just giving the facts. As for me - I am staying Holyday Inn or Ramada next time.My wife and I stayed at the W from June 18th through the 21st and I must say it exceeded all our expectations. From the moment we walked in we enjoyed ourselves. Everyone was very nice from the front desk to the valet to the bar staff to the concierge. As a matter of fact many of the staff remembered our names which to us was a nice touch. It is NOT the mainstream and I think that is one of the many things that we liked about the hotel. It is unique. Our room was on the 15th floor and was fabulous (and we dont use the ""f"" word lightly). The windows wrapped around the corner overlooking the city. It was nicely furnished and the bed was fantastic. Our entire experience was great. A bit pricey? Perhaps. Ill tell you this we will be back again and again.Great Hotel - Great service and atmosphere. I live in Seattle and often times stay downdown at this hotel for the 'city experience'. Corner rooms are the best - extra space and great views.
I often take my dog and they treat her like a celebrity!Just got back from a quick jaunt down to Seattle to catch a Mariners game, and stayed at the W for a night. After reading the wide mix of reviews on this site we were unsure of what we would find, but both my girlfriend and I enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again.
Yes, the lobby and hallways are dark and poorly lit, and yes, virtually everything in the room has a price tag on it, but once you get past that it's really a funky, contemporary, stylish place to stay while in Seattle. We especially enjoyed the comfortable king-sized bed, the romantic window bench with great views of the city, the room amenities and its funky style. We also had a great meal at their restaurant, Earth & Ocean - you have to try their incredible desserts.
We also found the hotel to be quite centrally located, within manageable walking distance of the football and baseball stadiums, Pike Place Market, and the Art Museum. The only real negative as far as I was concerned was the valet parking - at $30 a day it's a bit exhorbitant. All in all though, a good hotel.We left our room at 8:00am only to return at 3:00pm. to a dirty room. When I called down to the arrogant desk staff. I was told ""We have until 7:00pm to clean your room"". I had to ask for some clean towels and soap be brought up. About 10 minutes later the housekeeping manager called and said that we could be next on the clean-up list. We declined because how long would we had to wait for that! The only professional staff there is the parking valet staff.Hint for those, who are conditionned to react to technological signals: the sound of arriving or departing elevators is set so high, that you'll easily get awaked by it - a couple of times ... The three rooms at each end of an aisle are okay.I recently was ""housed"" at the W Hotel Seattle for a major summit, and having a five star hotel paid for by our host was something I very much appreciated and looked forward to.
What a disappointment. The ""W"" is the most pretentious hotel I have ever been in. The halls are left dark with dimmed blue light, so one of the only nice things the hotel has to offer, the black and white photos that decorate the halls and rooms, were impossible to see. The rooms are austere. Not a drawer to be found in the contemporary dark wood, glass and chrome furniture. Every place a catalog or price list could be displayed, it was, even the furniture was for sale. I felt like I was in an Ikea showroom... no... even they have more class.
I was ""stationed"" on the 14th floor, and had a parking lot under the window of my room. The fancy shower had a drain that worked intermittently, apparently based upon who else was running a shower on floors above or below. I discovered why the little ambient fountain in my room had been left off... when I tried it, the thing leaked water all over my valuable papers on the writing desk (also covered with sales catalogs supplied by the W).
The rooms are large and have a large color TV, VCR, CD player, and according to one travel guide were supposed to have a ""library of CDs and videos"", but I guess they were all taken out and ""overdue"", because there were none in my room (other than that wonderful W Hotel CD which was for sale) .
From the seemingly stale $3 (plus 20% service fee) candy bars and soda pop, to the $8 bottled water and W Hotel CD everything was overpriced and underwhelming.
By far the worst was the desk staff; arrogant, hostile unbending and unhelpful. They never cracked a smile the whole four days, or acknowledged me. However, they did try to charge a number of the members of our group (including myself) for an extra day that was already paid for by our sponsor. The bar service went well with the rest of the feel of the place. A small order of quite costly appetizers on a slow night took nearly an hour to be served.
The one nice thing was the large bed. However, it was way too soft due to the feather cover. There were six jumbo down pillows also, which literally left no room on the bed to sleep in it. And no matter how many times I removed them, they were back the next day after housekeeping came by.
One thing I noticed on my 3rd day which pretty well summed up how I felt about my stay there. They have a large WELCOME sign made of metal letters on the door. However, it can only be read correctly when you LEAVE (it's backwards on the way in)... It's very symbolic. This hotel WELCOMES you to leave, and if you're smart you'll take the hint before making your reservation.
Our group was large and 5 five star hotels within the Seattle core were used. Most people enjoyed their stay at the other four, so I imagine you can do fine staying someplace else - the Renaissance was a favorite.
And, by the way, our group (1300 people) ranged in age from 16 to about 70 years of age, and most are well traveled, due to their work.I am a fan of the W Hotels Worldwide chain and the W Seattle did nothing to dissuade me. There were a few small snafus, however, the management handled these with care and courtesy.
I will start with the positives: The concierge was fabulous, my husband needed a haircut and they recommended Rudy's Barber Shop which did a great job at a very reasonable $10! The rooms were spacious and the beds wonderfully comfortable. The nightime lobby bar was not as 'happening' as in some other cities, however, it was comfortably crowded with beautiful people for a Saturday night and the drinks came quickly and were well-mixed.
Some negatives: They charged a friend of ours for a full day of parking when he was only there two hours - we mentioned it to the front desk staff and they promptly corrected this on our bill. Also, we stopped by the front desk at about midnight and asked for a wake-up call for the next morning as we had an international flight to catch, but the call never came, and our 'backup' alarm never went off - so we missed our flight. We were fortunate enough to get on another flight at a minor cost which delayed us approximately half a day. I wrote a letter to the Starwood Customer service center and copied the general manager of the W Seattle. Within 3 days I received a letter from the G.M. stating that they would refund our one night stay in full due to their error. 
In summary, if you like the ambiance and feel of the W Hotel chain or if you are just looking for a convenient and hip hotel with great service in Seattle you will not be dissappointed with the W Hotel.I was in Seattle a few months ago on business. The W was in a great spot. I'm not huge fan of riding on a bus, but Seattle has free bus service within a certain radius downtown. The W is in the center so it's so easy to get around. Short walk from the Market and if you're up for it - about 10 to 15 min walk to the space needle. Service was friendly. I arrived early in the a.m. so my room wasn't ready but they checked me in and sent me a text message when it was. I found that pretty cool. Rooms were extravagent, great Starwood/Sheraton-esque beds. Though one downside was the halls were a little dark (typical of a trendier hotel, like those you see in NYC). The bar in the lobby was always jumping and I heard from some other guests that the breakfast was excellent. When I checked in they gave me 2 drink coupons.
Hit up Belltown section (short walk) of the city. Great restaurants and cuisine of every kind! BlueWater Grille on Lake Union is also very good. Whether doing business in Seattle or visiting, the W is a good choice. Little pricier, but for a downtown location, the rooms were large and service was good. Worth the extra bucks.Love the contemporary furnishing, big windows, great view of downtown Seattle, huge bathroom and with huge mirror, great location. Some friends flew in from Pheonix and stayed at the W, I had always seen the Hotel living in Seattle but have never stayed there until they came into town. If you love a different type of atmosphere , more contemporary, hip and stylish, the W is the place to stay!Truly an excellent experience from the wonderful corner room with its floor to ceiling windows to the wonderful Earth & Ocean restaurant. The staff were very helpful and no request was too much trouble. The beds are a cut above the usual hotel standard and the furnishings and decor are very stylish yet totally functional. Combine all this with a great location and you have a superb base for any business trip to Seattle.After a night out on the town a friend and I decided to get a room at the W instead of driving home. What a great decision this was! No, it's not for everyone. Just as I would not put someone young into an old stodgy hotel, I would not recommend this hotel for business travellers or my grandma. But we got there late, about 2am, and absolutely loved the room. It was a good size, loved the art and the bathroom was so clean and well laid out. Called room service at 3 am and had food brought up very quickly by a great woman who took the time to tell me her name and to let me know whatever I needed food wise to call her right up! All in all I had a wonderful time and look forward to staying again.Nice comfortable room with good amenities. nice gym which was free. nice concierge staff. No room service menu when we checked in at midnight. front desk gave us a verbal menu as no room service menu found in entire hotel....went to eat at the w lobby bar instead $90 for fries, avocado, 2 glass of merlot and beer...unfortunately nothing within walking distance at that hour.
not sure what regular price but thru hotwire it was worth it. only complaint was the limitations of food latenight other than that good property.The W might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you love style and something different, this could be the place for you. Other reviews have described the striking decor and style of service, so I won't repeat it here. I found the style a bit over the top but still a pleasant change from the corporate sameness of other upscale hotels. The staff was very attentive to meeting all my needs and even remembered my name. The valet promptly delivered the car whenever I needed it, although many attractions are within walking distance (Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, the Seattle Art Museum, etc.). We were given a top floor room even though the discount we received only entitled us to floors in the lower half of the hotel. The beds are as comfortable as advertised. The window couch was comfortable and such a great idea one wonders why other hotels haven't copied this idea. The bathroom was excellent. This is a great hotel and if you can get a decent price, take advantage of it.I bought into the ""W"" thing early on but I am so over it. Everything in this hotel seems darker than even the other W's I stayed in. When you come in from walking around the city you cannot see a thing let alone find a key. And the loud, thumping ""music"" that fills the lobby is not what I want to hear after a long work day. I could not even hear the desk staff. The rooms are way over priced (give me the Sheraton or Westin dream beds!) and I want to see if my room is clean (can't in the dark.) And for a place so dark- blinds on the window that let in all the outside light when you finally do get in bed. They offered to hang ""black-out"" curtains so they must have heard this before. I took them up on it the next day. it was a black metal rod crammed in the window with thin, black fabric safety pinned over the rod! Not much better than the blinds! And it is Seattle - NO COFFEE MAKER! Don't even ask about their much touted restauarant - Just dont'!When you stay at a W Hotel you are in for an adjustment to your expectations. Depending on your personal point of view, you may find this refreshing, surprising, and wonder why there aren’t more people doing this sort of thing. Or, you may feel that these are just trashy
gimmicks directed at the hi-tech minded and geeky. So what’s different?
First thing is that instead of the gushing and verbose service that many concierges and reception staff employ, this luxury hotel employs
people who give the impression that everything is no big deal, easily
accomplished and in fact hardly worth a mention. In fact, they are often smiling but very direct and to the point in the delivery of their message. Some could mistake this for coolness and disinterest. 
Throughout the hotel alternative language abounds – the Concierge desk is titled: Whatever, Whenever. The sign for your door to ensure privacy says: Not Quite Yet! 
The second thing is décor. The reception area is minimalist meets gothic, with a touch of modern art, all dimly lit. At night the lights are even lower and the fireplace surrounded by candles is a centrepiece. Low coloured lights in corridors and hallways combined with vibrant carpets extend the effect of being in some kind of club.
Music is the third thing: ambient techno and jazz will accompany you everywhere except in your room. It all combines with the décor and the attitude to impress upon you that you are part of a hip and cool experience.
Rooms are also minimalist, although spacious. Our “Cool Corner Room was exactly that, affording a great view of the city on from two aspects at fifteen floors elevation.
Everything works, and works well in this hotel, especially technology. Your Flat Screen TV, DVD, Internet are all there, and the lobby if full of laptop users, also enjoying a cocktail. These are the sort of people that feel that a computer is an integral part of life, not just a machine with which you work.
On Saturdays the reception and bar area becomes a disco – still in the techno theme, and is obviously a cool Saturday evening rendezvous
for locals and visitors alike.
But, don’t think this hotel is exclusively for the young; its more that its designed to make you feel young, whatever your age. We say everyone from 18 to 80 in evidence, and most seemed to be enjoying the experience. We noted several Brides in their gowns arriving after their happy day, en route to a memorable night.
So, if you are the sort that might like your hotel experience to be something new and different try a W – and the Seattle W is a great one to try, both for quality and location. If you prefer leather sofas, marble floors and tradition, there’s a wonderful Fairmont around the corner, but why not give the W a try just one time? We did, and enjoyed the experience.We stayed at the ""W"" August 22-34, 2007. Overpriced and way over rated. Save your money and time. Good location is all it has going for it. Snobby staff and watch out for the valet and parking charges. Ask before you drop your car off what the charges are. Stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels and have NEVER been charged more than $20 per night as a guest of the hotel. ""W"" is $35.My wife and I recently stayed at the W Seattle and enjoyed our stay, but there are a few things that prevented me from rating the hotel higher than ""average."" 
First off, there wasn't a coffee maker in the room. I know it is Seattle and there is a Starbucks on every corner, but this is something that every hotel that I have ever stayed in has. 
Secondly, this place will nickel and dime you to death. For example: $35 a night for parking and $14 for a small ham and cheese sandwich in the restaurant.
I also did not like it when we walked into the hotel on Saturday night and found that the lobby had been turned into the most popular nightclub in Seattle. There was literally a D.J. spinning dance music records very loud in the lobby. All of the ""beautiful people"" were there and I was not impressed. 
If you are snobby, wealthy, or a self centered person this is the hotel for you. It is very dark and the decorations in the common areas are very ""artsy fartsy."" 
The only reason my wife and I stayed here, was that it was during Sea Fair, and I found a great rate on the W's website. 
The hotel is located in a fantastic location. 
We won't be returning.This is the swank hotel for Seattle. As a former resident of Seattle, this was my top pick for a place to stay and it exceeded my expectations. 
The W is in the perfect location with quick access to Downtown shopping, theater, Pike Street market, and the *must see* new public library.
The restaurant was little avant garde for me and a little pricy for what you get, but it was a good experience nonetheless. (Across the street is Sazarac in the Monaco hotel...I'd recommend that for the eating).Stayed here for a few nights on a business trip, great hotel, great room, and great food near by.The W in Seattle is in a good centre location for access to everywhere, only about 5 blocks to the downtown shopping and easy walkable distance other places. Its on the corner of a street and so doesn’t have the fancy drive that the Fairmont on the next block has. If coming from the airport Greyline does an airporter service, get it to the Fairmont and it leaves you across the road from the W $10.25 single, $17 return.
The W has low lighting with candles and so gives the impression of a nightclub 24/7. This takes a little getting used to, you have to be pretty much standing at your room door before you can see the number. The lobby also has funky music all day, chill out in the morning and more upbeat in the evening. I liked it but I can see how some older people may not. The living room lobby is comfy but it is constantly used during the day by business people having meetings and working
All staff were really friendly and helpful although when I did use the concierge I wasn’t that impressed. I asked him for information about Mt St Helens – the biggest tourist attraction in the state of Washington- and he could barely produce driving directions.
The rooms were lovely, spacious and comfortable though. The beds were fantastic and so comfortable with goose down pillows which I loved, got a fantastic night sleep in them. The flat screen TV is above the desk which I didn’t like as if one person is working at the desk and the other is watching TV it can prove very distracting. Also the W doesn’t seem to provide too much for the business user. There is no Wi-Fi in the rooms and internet is $14.95 per day. The business centre also closes early and doesn’t open on a Sunday.
The bathroom is spacious and very well lit for applying make up, the toiletries are provided by bliss and are really nice.
Like all expensive hotels are you are charged for everything you use, the bottle of water in the room is $10 and of course there is a mini bar. Room service is available but a chicken sandwich is $18 and pancakes are $15, then there is a 2% added on, $3.50 delivery charge as well as the regular tax, so it can prove really expensive
There is a gym present but it is nothing fancy, just a room with a few cardio machines and loose weights but is functional.
The restaurant is nice and the waiting staff are fantastic. Food is very good. I recommend the steak frites. The restaurant is closed on a Sunday though. The bar is nice and trendy although not exceptionally big. A DJ plays there on the weekends.
All in all my stay was lovely and I enjoyed it, I would return for the beds alone but I found the place a bit too trendy and stylish and apart from the room not especially comfortable.My first experience with a W and probably not the last. Arriving early, we were upgraded to one of the ""w"" named rooms whose designation escapes me at the moment. (Methinks they go a little overboard with all the ""w"" lingo) Check in was fast and efficient and the bell staff very good and quick.
The room was large with a large sofa, king bed, desk, flat screen TV, robes and a huge bathroom. The condition of the furnishings was very good with no wear and tear noted. One note, if you are somewhat less than agile, the bath/shower required quite a step over the edge.
Views from the upper floors are good with three sides offering a view of the Sound and the fourth of central downtown. Corridors are not well ighted as is typical of a W but more than adequate to find the room and elevators.
The bed was comfortable although dealing with the 7 or 8 pillows was a struggle.
The location is excellent for shopping and sight seeing. The Public Market with the ""Flying fish"" and many other shops is about 5 blocks away and the spectacular Public Library one block over from the hotel entrance. There are many restaurants nearby as well as what seems to be hundreds of coffee shops, this being Seattle.
From what I have read before, this W is more or less typical of the chain. I recommend it to those who wish to be near the heart of Seattle and would stay again on vacation or business.This place feels like it tries too hard to be hip. Throbbing music loudly pulses in the lobby, most of the staff is comprised of young trendy men...you get the picture. I thought the bed and the housekeeping was excellent, as were the Bliss products in the bathroom. However, the concierge was condescending and not very helpful. And I found the darkness oppressive. The hallways were intentionally poorly lit, which seems crazy in gray Seattle. Next time I will stay somewhere with more warmth and charm.In many ways, very much the ""W"" experience: decor, vibe, service... which is a compliment. Though the lobby area is quite small, still very functional and service is very attentive and helpful. Unlike other W's, the elevators are quick! Gym is incredibly small and claustrophobic. Location is excellent - close to all the shops and Pike's Place Market. Good, reliable stay with excellent serviceIf you like the W experience, you'll feel right at home in the Seattle property. It's always dark and moody to convey a sense of sophisptication, but it's still a quality upscale business hotel beneath all the branding. The corner suites are very comfortable, with amenities I actually use (adequate deskspace, DVD player, a bathtub large enough to bathe in). 
The gym is small but features quality equipment unlike so many other business hotels. The bar is actually a happening hot spot, and I feel comfortable lounging in the hotel lobby with the free WiFi. The attached restaurant, Earth & Ocean, is overrated and quite expensive. 
Like most Ws, the staff are all pretty young hipsters, who nonetheless provide (for the most part) friendly service. I woud highly reccomend the hotel for those who are not bothered by the air of exclusivity that the brand projects, particularly if you can get good rate. In my experience, it has wildly fluctuated throughout the year for both 2006 and 2007.Was in town last weekend for my brother's wedding and stayed here. Arrived in the midst of a parade after one of the worst flying experiences of my life..and was thrilled to have check-in take all of 3 minutes before I was placed into an elevator and whisked up to the 22nd Fl. 
Room was impeccable; I loved the bathroom. View was fabulous. My 3 main nit-picky criteria with hotels that seperate the good from the great are 1.) full length mirror, 2.) lighting and 3.) pillows/bedding. This passed all 3 with flying colors. 
Above and beyond; the staff were amazing; not one bad apple in the bunch. Every staffer I encountered was competent, professional and very accomodating. A rarity when travelling today, there's usually at least 1 moron. 
The location was great too. I was a little pressed for time because of flight delays, but I was able to hit many of the tourist attractions Sunday morning. The Fish Market, the Space Needle monorail, and some great downtown shopping are all within blocks of the hotel.
If ever in Seattle again, I would not hesitate to stay there again. I would also recommend this to those who are traveling there.The W hotels are very consistent from city to city. When you're traveling for work, as I was on this trip, that's a good thing. It means I know the front desk will always make me feel special, there will be good Internet access (although I'll always curse when they make me pay for it at these hotel prices!), the room service will be tasty, and I'll get a great night's sleep. This W in particular was extra spacious, with a couch/coffee table sitting area. It's my second time staying there and I'd gladly do it again next time work sends me to Seattle.We had a very nice stay in this lovely, comfortable, swanky hotel. The location is superb...didn't need our car once. The service was good. The room was spacious with a nice sitting area and flat screen tv, a very luxurious bed and the bathroom was lovely. Unfortunately, we were either overcharged or mischarged twice (one we found three days after we left) so watch your credit card statements. The staff took care of the problem right away, so that is good. I would definitely stay here again. Oh! Avoid their garage...way too expensive. Park in the garage behind the hotel on 5th instead.Although my room had the dreaded ""parking garage view"" when I went for a conference, it had the by-far most comfy bed and couch EVER. Our conference seemed very overbooked and the meeting rooms were sardine can small. But the traveling latte bar, between-meeting snacks and on-table waters & candies made up for a lot of personal space invasion. WiFi free in lobby but for a charge in the room made you sort of want to hang out in the over-hip DJed afterdarkness of the couches in the evening. This is not a happening part of town in the evening. It has business district shutdown. Either stick to the lobby area or venture out into the farther neighborhoods. Walking down the dark halls to the blue-lit room numbers, I did feel like I was in ""Barton Fink"" or another Coen Bros. movie. Definitely a hotel for the post-hipster or the proto-wannabe. But, really, who can afford more than a night or two just for fun? It was a worthy adventure!After a crazy room rate $400 for a king room... this isn't MONTE CARLO, rate and for get having a $10 cocktail

I was charged for a FEDEX.... an envelope
Boycott - stay at the MONACO across the streetI loved my stay at the W in September 2003. The sales staff was accomodating and gave me a good rate, the rooms were sexy and the beds - to die for. Definately geared for pleasure and I had lots of it! The mini bar was stocked wtih good wine and champagne, the restaurant was yummy and the room service perfect. They made it a place I'll go back to again and again. You feel like your in a warm cocoon of hip sensuality.Very dark, depressing hallways and public areas. The halls are so dark as to be scary. Who knows who are what (a burglar? a lot of dirt?) might be lurking there. The staff is ridiculously pretentious and unhelpful. In an effort to appear high tech and trendy, this place has succeeded in being snobbish and cold. On the positive side, the rooms are well-furnished and comfortable, if a bit strangely decorated. But another negative is the lack of soundproofing. For a new hotel, the rooms seem to have surprisingly thin walls. A better choice, at less than half the price, is right next door: the venerable Pacific Plaza Hotel. Yes, its rooms are smaller, but they are comfortable and bright, and the staff is wonderful. The Pacific Plaza makes you feel right at home, and the price and location are right. If you prefer a trendier location, Hotel Monaco, across the street from the W and Pacific Plaza, is a much better choice for about the same price as the W. It is hip but not pretentious, and the staff's customer service skills are far superior to the W's.Stayed at the W for a professional conference at the same hotel. This hotel goes out of its way to be strange at the cost of livability. The halls are so dark that they would do better to stock the ""in-room store"" with tiny flashlights - those they could sell. A few of us at the conference made fun of the hotel during discussion. I had a menu card in my room the first night that I could fill out and hang on the door to get a room service breakfast. I did that the first night, and it was good, but I never got another menu in my room to do that again. 
What happened? They tried to charge me for parking for 3 nights - I didn't drive a car there. Strangely, I never got a survey or comments card to fill out, either. I'll try somewhere else next time.I have booked several friends into this super modern hotel and have also checked out the rooms and eaten in the restaurant (Earth & Ocean) myself. The rooms are drop-dead gorgeous in a modern vein, as are the public spaces of the hotel. The staff are excellent--eager to please, but casual, not haughty. The restaurant is probably the best in Seattle at the present time. I have also had friends stay at the Four Seasons and there is no comparison--the W is a charmer, the Four Seasons is the worst in their chain.
News Flash: Four Seasons just wised up and have sold their Seattle hotel to the Fairmont group.Stayed there for one night.... great atmosphere, horrible lighting, outstanding furnishings - typical neo W hotel. 
However, the Hotel likes to charge for everything - even for things you don't use. They charged me for drinking the water from the honor bar which i never touched. When i called the billing department to correct the charge, they were unapologetic, though they said they would reverse the charges only after i had to raise my voice. 
Watch your wallet! And good luck with the billing department -- shameful behavior!I arrived in August around noon for a business stay--I was told that check-in was at 3 and my room should be ready by then. Fine--it was a beautiful day, I walked around the city, had lunch, visited the museum, and returned around 4:45. My room ended up not being ready until 5:15 and it was a closet on the level of the next building's roof. 20 feet away were large office windows so it was a little more open than I wanted. I'm a Starwood member and figured after the delay, they'd at least try and give me a decent room. I requested a change, and the room I finally got was nice enough, but this is still after six hours of waiting! Also, the halls are much too dark--I know it's supposed to be hip, but even hip people like to be able to see in a hotel hallway. Basically, the very young staff needs some training in customer service. Without it, luxurious, hip accommodations won't work.インテリアは、落ち着いた色でまとめられており、ソファー、ベッドの使い心地も良く、バスルームも広く
のんびりできました。
寒い時期でしたが空調も良く、ベッドもブランケットではなく、羽毛だったと思います。
部屋には、水、スナック類、ソーイングセットなど様々なものが準備されているのですが、その一つ一つに値段が付いています…ミニバーと思えば当然なのですが、ソーイングセットや水はサービスとして置いているホテルも多いのでなんとなく気になりました。
設備自体は問題ないです。シャンプー、リンス、石鹸、ボディークリームなどそろっておりドライヤーもあります。ポットはありませんでしたが、ロビーに聞くと持ってきてくれました。
朝寝坊をして朝食をとる時間がなかったのですが、サービスでコーヒーとリンゴがロビー前に置いてあり
嬉しかったです。Enfin un hôtel avec une bande passante Internet correcte. Les lits sont confortables et il est dans Seattle. Un coffre fort correct et des peignoirs dans la chambre.
En améliorant la douche dont le pommeau est ridiculement petit, en mettant quelques chaines internationales (que de l'anglais en 44 chaines, pas de HBO) et des chaussons dans les chambres ils seraient excellent. Je n'ai pas testé le petit déjeuner. 
Les chambres panoramiques commencent au 17ème étage, ce qui permet d'avoir une vue sur les autres gratte ciels du quartier. J'ai bien apprécié les emails de réservation, très clair et qui me donne même la météo au moment du sujet. 
Prix $185 la nuit ($215) en incluant les taxes, prix de groupe.Im Web-Auftritt will das W Hotel etwas Besonderes sein, in Wirklichkeit ist es das typische gut funktionierende Business Hotel an zentraler Lage. Die Zimmer sind gut ausgerüstet, der Wäscheservice ist schnell, die WLAN Performance ist knapp in Ordnung (störend ist nur, dass man das Passwort dauernd neu eingeben muss). Der Fittnessraum ist sehr eng und morgens um sechs schon rappelvoll. Das Frühstück wird serviert und scheint mir sehr teuer - da gehe ich lieber in das gegenüberliegende Starbucks Café.Ett bra hotell med typisk W känsla i centrala Seattle, med ett corner room blir utsikten optimal. Hotellet har hög standard på det mesta, servicen håller hög nivå och frukosten som serveras är i amerikansk anda. Smidig incheckning och en helt otrolig concierge service, allt som behöver vetas finns det svar på!The good: 
- The location of this hotel is great for those staying in downtown Seattle. You're within walking distrance of nearly all attractions and major business destinations. 
- Good selection of channels on the TV
- As with most W hotels, the bed is comfy . . . . but . . . . 
The bad: 
- My wife got bed bugs bites during our stay. Seriously. Obviously this is a major area of concern. I didn't realize that bed bugs were a real phenomenon, but apparently they are. 
- The valet/garage situation is terrible. Their loading area is far too small for the type of traffic (hotel guests and hipsters at the bar), and so you can wait 5 minutes to valet park your car. The parking staff tries really hard, but they just can't keep up in the cramped space. 
- Service was spotty. Some people were really helpful, others were totally indifferent. 
- Lousy water pressure in the shower. 
Indifferent: 
I always have mixed feelings about W hotels. I like the hip vibe in the lobby, but there are simple things that feel contrived. For instance, the lighting in the hallways is so dark, you can't see the room numbers. Admittedly a small detail, but sometimes you feel like convienece and ease come at the expense of ""cool"". I don't know . . . maybe I'm just getting old.We booked this hotel through American Express and received an upgrade to a corner room. 
The hotel attempts to be cool and edgy by refusing to light the lobby or hallways to a sufficient level. Our room was an Asian inspired minimalist decor which I did appreciate but the furniture lacked sturdiness and had seen better days. 
I was more disappointed in the service aspects of the hotel than in the room itself. Our room had no directory of hotel services and the front desk did not understand why we were requesting such information. The room service menu was uninspired and expensive. In Seattle on a Sunday evening after 9 p.m. room service was our only option. The general unfriendliness of the hotel staff was apparent.
Three of the four days of our stay we had to call and request housekeeping clean our room because it was past 4 p.m. and no one had been in to clean the room. 
This hotel puts too much emphasis on branding and not enough on guest comfort. It is way overpriced for the facilities and services offered.I chose to pay to stay at this hotel prior to a conference I was attending even though I had a free room at the convention hotel. I kind of regret it. The hotel is nice, no doubt. Has that edge of coolness that one would expect from a W. However, it is a bit rough around the edges. It seems like a really cool designer, designed the hotel and the execution was on the cheap…oops, have I just defined the W brand? Kidding. I live in Dallas and the W in Dallas is one incredible hotel. Definitely not on the cheap. I asked the manager about the state of the hotel and he replied that they were one of the older W hotels and realized their competition and image in other cities. Hopefully they will react and change some things. Unfortunately the things would be hard as they relate to their public areas, etc. These will involve a costly change. I have to throw my thanks to the bar staff here. What a great group. I had so much fun in the bar. Kudos.
Don’t miss The Pink Door. Great pasta and, trust me, you will get some type of show… Also, if you are a little adventurous, search out the restaurant Crave in Pacific Heights. The woman that owns this place is doing amazing things with food and you will delight in the 10 to 12 table environment. A little bohemian, but the food is amazing. You won’t regret it.The front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful. But, the hotel is too trendy, too dark and too noisy. 
The corridors are poorly lit and narrow. The room was shabby
and not very comfortable with a terrible view of a tall parking lot.
The window covers do a very poor job of keeping out light from
the parking lot which was well lit all night. Also, the windows do
not open at all and the air conditioner made loud noises all night.
The food was mediocre in the dining room. 
And , it was overpriced.
I will not return.First of all, I'm a Starwood Platinum Member and my family and I stayed for couple of nights here on the way to an Alaska cruise. I had reservation for two rooms using my Starwood points. Upon arrival around 1200pm, I was told that there was one of the rooms ready but the other was being cleaned. We decided to go around town and come back later.
At 4pm we arrived back to the hotel and requested our other room, and we were told that was not ready because the guests requested a late checkout and they are cleaning the room. I did not believe that and contacted the Platinum Starwood Member assistance to complain and to check the possiblity to go to the Sheraton couple of blocks away. Once I explained the issue they inmediately contacted the hotel manager and the room, that was not ready 15 minutes ago,now is ready. Wow that was fast!!!!
So five hours have gone by since we arrived and finally we have the rooms. The lobby was not that great. Music too loud that we could not hear each other talking. The rooms to fancy and lack of things that now, any other hotel has as a standard, such as microwave, coffee maker. 
I sent my son to get some ice. Yes, he found some on the 23 rd floor. one bottle of water was given to us as complementary due to the inconvinience for what happen during check in, the cost $8.00 each. and many more disappointments during the stay.
If you want coffee in the morning, they tell you to go across the street to Starbucks. Can you believe it!!!! Any way it is cheeper and better.
In summary, think twice if going there and staying here. It is not what is advirtised. And I agree with other people regarding hotel personnel. They only greet you upon arrival after that, you are one more guest/person at the hotel.W is chic and trendy. I liked it. My parents? Not so much. They weren't into the club/lounge scene at night and how dark the hallways were, but they were happy with the size and cleanliness of the room and bathroom.
The beds are heavenly (well, they are Simmons Heavenly Beds)! So plus and comfortable and warm. I'm buying one for myself next month! LOL! And I really liked the soaps, shampoos, etc...it's bliss (no pun intended, but seriously, the W uses Bliss Spa products)!
The staff greeted us when we walked in, but that was it. We looked for the concierge a few times, but couldn't find him. He was never at his desk. Thankfully, we found what we needed.
We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant as we were warned that it's expensive, but the W is within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and the Elliott Pier. The neighborhood is safe, but there isn't much around in terms of shopping and restaurant. Luckily, the shopping district is about a 15 minutes walk.
Upon checkout we were promptly greeted by the woman at the front desk and a bellhop helped us with our bags and flagged a cab.
I would stay here again, but if you're older then these types of hotels may not to be your liking. Like I wrote, my parents liked the room, but not the club scene in the lobby especially when we arrived back to the hotel after 10pm.シアトルの中心部、ユニバーサルstから２ブロックほど上ったところにある、オシャレなシティホテルです。
色調、設備、バーの雰囲気やフロントのスタップなど総合的に若い方向けのホテルです。
部屋もシンプルで使いやすく、ソファスペースも良かったですが、窓からの眺めは駐車場と少しはなれた向かいのホテルの窓だったためカーテンは開けませんでした。そのせいとデザインから少しお部屋は暗めです。　バスローブがついており、他の方の写真にあるとおり、シャンプー、リンス、洗顔、などが準備されています。もちろんミネラルウォーターも準備されています。
さすがシアトル、朝方はロビーにtogoできるコーヒーが準備され、コーヒー片手に散歩ができます。
昼過ぎは大きなブラウニーとハーブジュースが準備されていました。
便利で、清潔、使いやすく、シンプル、値段にも見合っていて良かったです。Back to the Seattle W, by choice based on our first visit. Nothing on the second stay disappointed us. We requested early check-in (1pm), late check-out (2pm) and a ""cool corner room"". Accomodating on every count without hesitation. The only complaint would be at check-in the desk clerk was really loud...wonder if that bluetooth in her ear was speaking to her at same time she processed our check-in? :] Only suggestion is for a hotel in this caliber in a city known for high tech, why not offer iPod docks? High design makes it hard to leave the room; wish we could plug in our music...The bad reviews on this site about this hotel are extremely misleading. I stayed at this hotel for a 5 day period and loved it. The hotel is excellent with great soft furnishings and amenities - the only thing I didnt like was the towels but the super comfortable bed more than made up for that. 
Also the reviewer who didnt like the lighting - get a flashlight - it was supremely hip and gave off an ambience of a MOD hotel and the lighting in the rooms is more than sufficient.
Now to discuss the service, they have a service desk called Whatever, Whenever. Well let me tell you they live that mantra. One member of my business group wanted to see an NBA match, so he asked at the desk about getting some - he got 2 seats 15 rows up handed to him in less than a minute. One person asked about getting to visit the restaurant at the tower - a reservation was made and when the couple sat down for dinner the waiter brought over a free appetiser courtesy of the W hotel. Last but not least another member of the group asked about getting a pick up at the Pike Street Market- the concierge himself went to do it.
THis hotel has 5 star accoutrements, service and is steps away from some of the best shopping (louis vuitton one street away).
You should enjoy any stay hereFor the price you pay, make sure you get one of the better rooms. When we first arrived they tried to put us in a lower level room that looked out directly to a parkade (basically all the cars going up can see you). I made a bit of a stink about it and two rooms later, I got the one I wanted, with a bit of a view for the same price. There's nothing extraordinary about this hotel, the gym is quaint, the rooms are small, the bathroom is actually really big, it was about 1/2 the size of the bedroom...the restaurant is pretty cool.I do a lot of business travel to Seattle and I like to stay downtown. I also like the Starwood brand because I think they have one of the best rewards programs. So I decided to try the W Seattle. I have stayed at many Ws accross the country and usually I love them. However, this W is just average. 
POSITIVES:
1. Location. Its right in the heart of downtown. 
2. The bed. This is a given in a W which, I believe, all use the ""Hevenly Bed."" I love this bed, it is pillowed topped and has nice linens and a huge (and heavy) down comforter. It is so confortable. I was so impressed with this bed the first time I stayed at a W in 2002 that I actually bought one. So its nice to have the same bed in the hotel that I enjoy every night at home. 
NEUTRALS:
1. The room. It was nicely appointed and had a nice window seat with lots of funky pillows. However, the view was of a hotel accross the street and as far as the theme of the room, I felt it was mediocre at best when comparting it to other W rooms I've visited in other states (like San Diego or New Orleans).
2. The staff. They were average at best, nothing out of the ordinary. Not particularly friendly or helpful but definately not rude, pushy or mean. 
NEGATIVES:
1. The lobby. Its tiny as compared to many Ws I've stayed in and the bar, while nice is TINY and often too crowded to even get a seat. One thing I've always enjoyed about Ws is the club-like feel of their lobbies and the cool bar scene. This W has neither. 
2. The elevator and hallways. They are extremely dark!! It is bizzare how dark they are. Maybe its to hide the fact that this hotel is an older hotel that's been renovated to become a W and so they darker down the hallways so that you can't see the age of it. However, I found it a tad unnerving and I'm a guy. 
3. Expensive: I paid over $325 for a night at this hotel and when compared against staying at the other Starwood properties in town (or any other hotel for that matter) that can generally be reserved for $200 or less, I think this hotel is a bit over-priced.My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel for five nights. They are a business hotel with wi-fi on floors 1, 2 and 3. If you're in your 
room, you pay. We ferried one small sliver of soap from the sink to the tub for a week. An interesting issue considering the price of this room. And the concierge. Hmmm. Well, if you wanted help, forget it. 
Not available and not interested. Go see the guys at the bar. They 
were really helpful about what's happening in Seattle! I won't stay here again. Its old, and not very clean.I really liked the W but do agree that the extra charges are a bit excessive. 22% room service fee along with $3.50 delivery charge, $36 to valet park, and dont touch the mini bar unless you want to pay $6 for a candy bar. The food is very good from the restaurant. The steak and sexy fries are especially good. I would definitely return to this hotel, probably without a car to park though. Once you get past the cost, it is a great hotel. They often have special offers, we paid about $200 a night in August. I loved the atmosphere, the Bliss products, and the room. Microsuede couch, comftorable bed, plasma tv with dvd player. It was nice after a long day to order room service and watch a movie. They also have an extensive library of cds, movies, and newspapers. We did not take advantage of this but the pay per view movie list was also convenient and featured new releases. When we checked in they had popsicles in ice buckets sitting out. Nice touch.
All of the staff is very friendly and helpful. They will bend over backwards to keep you happy. Anytime I called down for something, it was taken care of right away. The person who took our luggage out of the taxi accidentally left a small bag in there. We noticed it that night and got the run around from the cab company. We talked to someone at the front desk the next day, and within an hour the hotel had my bag back. Our luggage was loaded and unloaded for us so we didnt even have to bother with it. Taxis are waiting outside the hotel so you do not have to call one. Overall staying at this hotel was one of the nicer parts of our vacation.Hotel di primo piano ma che costa decisamente troppo rispetto a ciò che offre. Di assoluto primo piano il centro fitness con macchinari Technogym, i prodotti da bagno, la pulizia e l'arredamento moderno della camera. La posizione è buona (Seneta e la 4th Ave ossia 5 minuti dal centro) e vicino ad uno dei miei ristornati preferiti di Seattle (ho esperienza essendo stato tutto Gennaio ''12 e 2 settiman a Marzo ''12) ossia il Purple Cafè. Lati negativi sono la mancanza di qualsiasi cosa gratuita (dato il costo mi aspetterei perlomeno un mezzo litro di acqua gratis), di caffettiera in camera (caffè solo alla reception) e la luce in camera che oltre ad essere soffusa come letto in altre recensioni, soffre della mancanza di un unico interruttore per spegnere tutto come accade in altri hotel di livello anche inferiore. Per un prezzo minore insomma si trova di meglio a Seattle.Ich mag die W Hotels gerne, speziell das Design. Das W in Seattle ist allerdings etwas ""altmodischer"" und nicht ganz so stylish. Die Lobby ist gerade im Umbau und somit danach wird es sicher wieder sehr attraktiv sein. Habe ein Eckzimmer bekommen im 9.Stock. Konnte die Strasse sehr gut überblicken, aber eben auch recht gut hören.Ｗホテルなので期待していましたが、ソファー・ベッド・壁紙等が老朽化していて
残念でした。
しかし、ホテル内のレストランの食事は美味しかったです！！Magnifique hôtel très central dans downtown Seattle. 
Chambre ""spectacular"" au 19ieme étage, en effet spectaculaire :
- très belle vue sur la ville
- déco moderne et de bon gout
- coin salon composé d'une grand banquette encastrée devant la baie vitrée
- très bonne literie
- salle de bain parfaite également.
On est dans le haut de gamme, mais assez abordable en offre de dernière minute.
Deux petites réserves cependant :
- accueil parfois un peu débordé, nécessiterait éventuellement un peu plus de personnel
- wifi payant, ce qui apparait comme un peu mesquin dans un hotel de cette gamme.I surprised my girlfriend with a night at the W to celebrate our anniversary. Although we booked a simple room and obviously weren’t high-rollers we were still treated as royalty. The valets were great, the staff was friendly and helpful, and when they found out that it was our anniversary they sent up an amazing bottle of champagne. We never had to open a door for ourselves or bother hailing our own cab. This place is well worth the money. The room was nice and the bed was amazing. Thank you Adam S ! He was our “W insider” and offered us excellent service and plenty of charm. If you are in Seattle for a night, or just want to treat yourself … this is the place to go.We arrived at the hotel by car and knowingly paid the high valet parking rate (if you don't want to pay it, street park - it's a major city).
The Staff were welcoming and the room was available on arrival, despite being early.
We passed through the dimly lit hallways (trendy, but I prefer to see) to our room. 
Spacious room, comfy beds, modern lighting / decor, large flat screen TV, safe, iron & board, small bathroom (shower over bath, not separate). Nice touch was a printer in the room, great for business use.
Views are not brilliant, as the hotel is surrounded by other tall buildings.
The bar is bustling and trendy, as is the lobby area (free WiFi for guests). Hotel location is great for shops and restaurants.
If you are not into trendy style, try the more expensive Fairmont next door.
If you like this hotel, I recommend 'Purple' for lunch, a great wine bar just down the road from the hotel and Barolo for dinner (take a cab, it's opposite the Westin but you will need to book).Well as contrary to belief, you don't get more when you pay more. I booked 2 rooms in the W hotel for a Saturday night. It was in celebration of my best friends birthday. The staff was very snotty, and we checked in at 3:00 p.m. , only to find out that the rooms that I had asked for ( side by side, and not facing an ugly garage etc) were not ready.We ended up 3 floors apart, both facing the uglyiest bulidings! This was after we paid in full, at the time of booking, and we were told to let them know if there was anything they could do to make our stay better, to let them know. I parked in the hotel parking lot for $35.00! What a rip-off! 2 people actually tried to open our door! And they were sucessful! The few things we needed were not dealt with, and when my husband brought a bag to the front desk before our dinner reservation , he was told they would send it to our room. We made it back to find a huge crowd, listening to some techno beat music in the bar. The bartender was a rude young kid, and thought he was Tom Cruise in "" Cocktail"". When we made up to our room, the bag was no where in site! I went down to the front desk, where I was basically told, that we made it up . The bag was no where to be found , with brand new clothes from Macys in it. I waited until morning to talk to the manager, who was at least friendly, and after awhile, he found the missing bag!! Wow, imagine that! You would assume that everyone employed by a 5 star hotel, would have to meet the requirement of overly friendly , but not here. I had better service and a nicer hotel, just a few streets away at the Warwick! The room was dusty, and don't even think about drinking the water. I know its cool to be classy, but even with my status , I refuse to pay $8.00 for a bottle of water that should be in my room for free. Bottom line, either spend more and go to the Fairmont, or find another good, 5 star. This is not the one, trust me!!Overall, excellent W hotel. Wonderful location in downtown Seattle. Very close to shopping, and close to many businesses. Rooms are fantastic. Great space, awesome amenities and wonderful atmosphere. 
Staff is very friendly and service is great. Only thing, don't count on an extensive room service menu. And, on Sunday nights, the restaurant isn't open. As a business traveler, I find this odd. But, breakfast is great.Schönes Hotel an guter Lage. Perfekt erreichbar mit dem Zug vom Flughafen. Die meisten Attraktionen sind zu Fus gut erreichbar. Einziger Minuspunkt ist, dass man fürs Internet pro Tag und Gerät 14.95$ bezahlen muss. Wenn man zum Beispiel ein Netbook und ein Smartphone hat, fallen 2x die Gebühren an. Bei den hohen Hotelpreisen ist das schon ein rip offLA posizione dell'Hotel è centralissimo. E' possibile raggiungere a piedi tutte le attrazioni della bella città. La zona del mercato è appena a 3 blocchi.
Durante il nostro soggiorno era anche attivo un servizio Limousine gratuito per raggiungere tutte le destinazioni più lontane (poche).
Le camere sono ottime, pulizia eccellente, standard elevato nordamericano.
Il parcheggio è un po' caro ma d'altra parte questo è lo scotto per essere in zona centralissima.
Niente da eccepire sul personale sia alla reception che in cameraDas Hotel liegt gut im Zentrum von Seattle.
Es hat ein recht teures Vallet Parking, gleich daneben ist jedoch ein Parking.
Die Lüftung im Zimmer ist sehr extrem laut aber da die Fenster nicht geöffnet werden könne, leider ein Muss.
Negativ sind auch die Spanteppiche.
Internet ist nicht inbegrifen.
Es hat zwar einen Fitnessraum, jedoch fehlt ein Whirlpool oder ein Schwimmbad.
Die Hotelbar ist ok jedoch zu laut, um etwas zu besprechen.シアトルのダウンタウンにあり、ダウンタウン内でしたら徒歩で移動できます。starwood系の中でスタイリッシュなイメージのWホテルですが、その通りでした。
午前中に到着したのですが、フロントではキャンドルが灯り、照明は控えめでフロアの廊下も紫系の色で統一されていました。お部屋は充分な広さでした。
宿泊したのがちょうど金曜で、夜11時ごろホテルに戻ってくるとロビー脇のバーかレストランのようなところはたくさんの人で盛り上がっていてラウンジかクラブのような雰囲気でした。そういう雰囲気が苦手な方にはお勧めできないかも知れません。Wir waren für zwei Tage im W Seattle und hatten ein Zimmer mit Aussicht auf die Stadt und das Wasser - das war natürlich toll.
Grundsätzlich ist das W in Seattle nicht so durchgestylt wie die anderen W-Hotels, also eher normal. Sehr ordentlich. Die Zimmer erstaunlich geräumig für W. Der Eingangsbereich ist etwas merkwürdig - von der 4th Avenue aus muss man über fiese Treppen zur Lobby, und von der Nebenstraße durch einen kleinen Seiteneingang sein Gepäck in die Lobby zwängen - also die Gestaltung des Empfangsbereich ist wirklich sehr merkwürdig.
Auf den Zimmern gibt es keine Kaffeemaschine - das war SEHR ungewöhnlich, gibt es die in den USA doch sonst in jedem Motel... Aber es gibt immer frischen Kaffee unten in der Lobby umsonst.
Das Hotel liegt prima, um an der Waterfront abends Essen zu gehen oder sonst auch die Stadt zu erkunden. Wir fuhren mit der Straßenbahn (lightrail) direkt vom Flughafen zum Hotel (einen Block die Straße hochlaufen) - das war klasse. Und mit 2.75 USD unschlagbar preiswert.
Würde dieses Hotel in Seattle wirklich weiterempfehlen und dort wieder übernachten, wenn der Preis ok ist.
Klasse ist natürlich der Acura- Shuttle-Service, den auch dieses W-Hotel hat. Da braucht man dann für innerstädtische Fahrten kein Taxi oder so. Wunderbar.The best thing about the W hotel is its location right in the centre of downtown Seattle very near ear all the main sights and shopping areas. There are many other hotels in the same area however so I reccommend that you shop around for the best deal becasue the worst aspect of the W seattle is its very high prices!
Best things:
- Location
- Nice comfortable rooms
Worst things:
- Cost
- Dingy Lighting (i think that they are trying to be cool but its a bit lame in reality)
- Decour is already starting to wear in some places.
Overall I would recomment the W hotel in Seattle. Just try and get a better deal on the room than I did.Ahh The W Seattle! I am a SPG Plat member and ""W The Card holder. Lately when in Seattle on business I have been staying at the HYATT downtown, but because of a convention at that property I was back at my old stomping grounds THE W.
Once a flagship of THE W chain, she is showing a little bit of wear and tear here and there. 
The Staff was great as expected except the concierge, who was was a bit too impressed with himself.
The hallways/elevators are very dimly lit, with a sexy ambiance, this hotel is for the movers and shakers, the style makers, or people who think they have style! I personally love it.
Once inside the rooms you have the wonderful signature W Beds which are quite simply amazing. One of the most comfortable beds you will experience. Mod decor abounds in the rooms with great flat screen TVs and a well appointed bathroom. All of the Bathroom products are provided by BLISS Spa's and you will want to take home the face wash and body lotion, they are that good!
My only complaint (and to some this may be a plus) is that it is difficult to get the rooms dark. When I am in Seattle I work late and sleep in, I am usually upgraded to a Corner King room which has amazing views but is difficult to darken, especially when I want to sleep in.
The blinds are a so-so at best shutters that just don't block sunlight (reason why I have been over at The Hyatt lately instead).
The restaurant /room service is amazing and the bar is great. Last year Quentin Tarantino was at the bar with a lady friend having a drink on a Thursday night! (I don't spot too many celebrities in my hotel travels)
No coffee makers in the rooms (urghh pet peeve!) I like to make a cup of coffee without having to go downstairs for the free coffee or order a $16 small pot from room service.
Overall though it is a wonderful property with a great location and good staff, on the trendy, high-end side of things so if you are stuffy and grumpy or like to get to bed very early, try the Fairmont next door (which has the best Oysters and Salmon in Seattle at the restaurant ""Shucker's"" on their ground floor.) But if you want to stay with the fashionista boutique brigade, give it a go!!!!All you need to know about the W Seattle is that the main entrance is barely marked, and when you walk in the door there isn't a check-in desk or staff member in sight. For the first time traveler, it's bewildering.
Once you realize the ""Welcome Desk"" is up the grand flight of stairs to your left, the staff is professional and helpful, and they have your keys at the ready. The elevator is smooth and fast, taking you up the two dozen floors without effort. The hallways are shockingly dim in comparison to most hotels, but not enough to impede vision, and I believe it helps with keeping the noise down at night.
The room is expertly designed New York anal-retentive, and I mean that in the best possible way. Absolutely nothing is out of place, from the tub mat to the pillows on the bed. There are no visible drawers, those are in the closet, along with real hangers and a second bathrobe. The hotel information binder has been replaced by a stack of cards bound on a large brad, which keeps the size down. There's no phone book, because that would require a drawer, though there is a flat panel television with high-definition content. The finishings are not exactly luxurious in the traditional sense but they are attractive, and everything in the room matches just so. The bed, sheets, and towels are all top quality. You would not be at all ashamed to have this as your guest room, even if you lived in a much nicer house than I do.
The prices are high. $36 to park, $15 for Internet in the room, $20+3.50 for delivery and a 22% service fee for an omelette can quickly turn a W stay into an extremely expensive proposition. Thankfully the staff recommended the excellent pastry shop across the street where there were Parisian-quality croissants and good coffee. The location is right in the center of downtown, though the proximity to the convention center means there are not many of the smaller restaurants that one might find in another city.
In summary, the W is a beautiful, expensive hotel with great service that is perhaps not the most practical, especially if you've got a family with you. Still, if you stay at the W you know what kind of experience you're getting.I stayed at the Seattle W for a week in June for a professional conference. I had previously stayed at the W in New Orleans and loved every second of it so I was expecting great things from the W Seattle. I couldn't have been more disappointed. They think darkness equates to ambiance. Wrong. There was no loud music on the elevators. At a W, the elevators are supposed to me like mini-clubs. You meet and party with people on the New Orleans W elevators. 
The worst thing was the smell when the air conditioning went on. It could best be described at cat little box or pure cat urine. Hotel management did not respond to numerous complaints saying that was the normal ""lavender musk"" smell of the W. Right... I just made sure the air never came on when I was in the room. Luckily, Seattle is a great city with lots to do.
I did get an email apology from corporate after logging a complaint with Starwood during my stay. Since then, I've only recieved marketing spam from the Seattle W. 
I'll never stay at the Seattle W again and won't recommend it to anyone.It was Christmas time in Seattle. I guess the W gave us a rate of 140.00 as a gift. And it was a nice one. Rooms are spacious and well designed. Staff members are helpful and pleasant.
A word of warning: drinks in the lobby bar are strong and good. I'm still a little hung over, and it's February.We stayed there on that Saturday after Valentines and were excited to get a really good rate for that night ($168), but paid a ridiculous valet rate. The overall decor of the hotel is really trendy and hip. The lobby is a little too dark and small for my liking--it got super crowded when people all of the sudden are checking in or checking out. Service was ok, front desk could have been a little more friendly and excited to be there working. The room has a stale decor; it's not as aesthetically pleasing as the rest of the hotel. Because the walls in the rooms are white, a lot of scuff marks can be seen, so you feel kinda like its been severely used/abused, and dirty. The beds are really comfy and the bathrooms are roomy. The location is great, we had no problem getting around via bus (which is free in the immediate areas) or walking. Overall, we were disappointed with our stay and wont stay again, especially if we have to pay more than we did. I'd stay at their sister hotel, the Sheraton down the street.I'm young and love to be out on the town. Going to Seattle I had planned on visiting all the sites I could manage on a weekend getaway and the W was my choice for a Hotel. I had an upgrade to a Cool Corner room and everything was so modern and clean. I loved the lemon + sage Bliss bath products. Going out at night was great too since all the clubs were within short distance of the W. When I returned from sightseeing or partying there was still a party going on in the lobby at the W! I I would recommend the W for a good time.I travel regularly for business and stay at the W in LA whenever possible. I was excited to stay at this property for this first time when business brought me to Seattle. I took a cab, and upon arrival had to carry my baggage up a flight of stairs to check in. There was no doorman at the door where I entered and no one offered me help although I checked in at a slow time of day. My room, while certainly not the same sort of room I had in LA, was clean and the in window seat a nice touch. The beds, true to W style, were fabulous and I always appreciate the bliss spa products. And that's about the end of the positives. 
They were a lot of overlooked details, and those details are what seperates a great hotel from the mediocre. I booked straight through the hotel website for a 2 night stay. I saw that the rate went down later in the week, so I was surprised when I was given a room right off of the elevator. I heard people talking outside the elevator in my room. The look on my door was sticky and I had to slam the door very hard to shut it. If I didn't shut it hard behind me, it would have been propped open. The first morning I did not receive a paper and the internet was spotty throughout the whole visit; I eventually just gave up and used my blackberry. The gym, while pretty well equipped for a downtown hotel, has in need of maintenance with only half of the cardio machines in full working order and the water cooler was empty. I gave the front desk this feedback as I was checking out in the morning and while I was listened to, was not compensated or offered a discount on my bill. 
Not a 4 star hotel, and certainly not a place I would stay again. It was service more along the lines of a 2 star average chain hotel, not what I have come to expect from the W.The decor and cleanliness was super. I have never been in such a posh hotel. Location was excellent, you could walk everywhere downtown. I must say though, parking is very expensive. $33 USD dollars a night. You might not need to bring/rent a car because everything is at your doorstep. 
The service was wonderful. The bellman and valet were quick to bring my luggage up and I didn't even have to wait 5 minutes for my car. The lady at check-in, Nohan (front desk manager) was so friendly. 
The mini bar is stocked, so not much room to store personal items. There is also no microwave. I was a bit disappointed with the room service menu, there weren't many things to order from! 
The washroom decor is very designer like. They carried Bliss products, and I must say, they are the best! I didn't even use my own shampoo/soap/conditioner/facial wash, it was all provided and top quality (not harsh and grainy like other hotel products!!) The products were so good I took a trip down to Nordstrom and purchased a few items. 
Beaware, local calls are $1.50 each and if you have a pre-paid calling card with a toll free number, it still cost's more than a local call, $2 to use a phone card from you room!! 
The gym is tidy and lots of workout equipment to chose from. The room also provides bathrobes, in room safe and umbrellas (considering it's raining all the time in Seattle) 
Overall, a great stay with impeccable service. Expect to pay more though!If you like great design hotels, the W Seattle is for you!
The location is good, only a few flocks from many of the downtown sites.
I was lucky enough to get a corner room, they are quite large, very comfortable (the bed and linen are fantastic), with great views and a pleasant feel, also the bathroom was large.
The lobby is beautiful with sofas, books, and great design.
If you stay on weekends there is a DJ at the bar, it's one of the fashion place in Seattle.
However if the concierge service is good, the staff at the reception was not so great. They even add a parking fee to my bill (quite funny when you're travelling without a car).
With nicer people at the reception I would give 5 stars to the W Seattle.BOOKING: 
Was at the hotel for my company's conference, booked via Hotel's dedicated conference site. OK experience. 
DIRECTION:
Took cab from SEATAC, took 30 mins. $35-40USD. Easy drive as it was 2 blocks off the freeway exit. 
STAY:
New & modern, good hardware overall, very comfortable bed, BLISS Spa products, flat screen TV, in-room safe, Kohler toilet fixtures, small but adequate gym. Standard things you would expect from a SPG property. 
STAFF:
However, staff was not friendly. I arrived at 11AM, hotel was not busy at all. The bellhop took my luggage from the taxi and simply left it by the check-in counter and walked off without offering to have it be delivered to my room. Not that I had a big luggage, but thought it was odd that a 4 star hotel would treat guest like that. 
On a separate occasion, I went to the front desk with 2 large boxes and asked if they can help FEDEX it out. They simply looked at me and said ""you should bring those to the 3rd floor business center""... again, did not offer to assist and the way they ""instructed"" me to go to the 3rd floor was quite rude. 
Neither incidents was a big deal... but their service delivery or lack of service delivery... put a damper on the overall experience. 
VIEW:
Try to get a ""Kool Korner"" room and a higher floor (15th or higher) to get a better view, mine was on 9th and looked out to other buildings. 
FOOD:
I must admit that I've never had such great hotel food. Our conference had about 200 people and the quality of the food was surprisingly good. Even at our 'coffee break', in addition to your traditional coffee & tea, we were offered smoothies, which was quite refreshing. 
VERDICT:
Great hotel & location overall, just be mindful of the ""attitude"" from staff. Which is why I only gave a grade of ""Neutral/Average""We stayed at this hotel for 1 night in January. We received an upgrade to a faboulous corner room (on floor 16). Our room had a somewhat view of the water. 
Positves:
Liked the dimly lit hallways (mood lighting) and elevator music. 
Walk to shopping and restaurants 
Very comfy bed, one of the better hotel beds we have slept in. 
Nice room , great style, very nice bath products (by bliss spa). Dvd player in room.
Great water pressure in shower
No outside hallway noise could be heard in room.
Great bar area downstairs (The W bar).
Negatives:
Loud outside road noise. But you are in a downtown hotel. We didn't think you would still be able to hear traffic down below, but you definitely could!
No room darkening shades (room just had wood venetian blinds - light still came through.)
Way to exspensive to rent in room movie &13.99 plus tax, food spendy from in room menu and mini bar way to spendy as well (but again that's would hotels do, they charge an arm and a leg for things!). It would be nice for once if some of these exspensive hotels would not do this.Great beds, uncomplicated... once you can work the lights. Ask for a deal.. you will get one, good location and parking. One of the better downtown hotels.
Meals can be slow to arrive.シアトルのダウンタウンはそんなに大きくないので、２キロくらい歩ける人は、このホテルから大体の観光名所には徒歩で行けると思います。車の人は、ホテルの周りが一方通行なので、4th Ave.側からだと駐車場に入れません。一度5thまで上って、一方通行の道をホテル裏手に入り、駐車場に入ります。最初に駐車場が分からず迷ったので、要注意です。
ホテル全体的には良かったと思いますが、部屋のベットサイドのテーブルに、誰かの髪の毛や埃がのっていたことと、グラスが汚かったことが気になったので、清潔感のポイントを下げました。このクラスのホテルは、そういう所ももっと気にしてほしいです。７月のシアトルは大変気候が良いのでお勧めです。Das W Hotel befindet sich direkt neben der Seattle Public Library und ist modern ausgestattet.
Während die Hotelzimmer keine Minibar oder Kaffeetablett enthalten, gibt es morgens kostenfreien Kaffee, Tee etc in der Lobby. Nicht, dass uns das Personal beim Check-in darauf aufmerksam gemacht hätte. Ausserdem gibt es samstags DJs und Musik in der Lobby - die gegenüber der Bar angelegt ist.
Das Fitness-studio soll, laut meiner Kollegin, gut und geräumig sein, hatte mich allerdings nicht selbst davon überzeugt.
Das Zimmer war recht geräumig - leider gab es keinen Safe und Internetzugang für 24 Stunden kostete ca. 15 Dollar.Das W Hotel in Seattle mag auf der ganzen Linie zu überzeugen:
- Lage: Perfekt für Erkundungen von Downtwon Seattle, diveres gute Restaurants 1-2 Blocks entfernt. Die Lightrail vom/zum Flughafen stoppt einen Block vom Hotel
- Zimmer: Wie von W Hotels gewohnt sehr stylisch, trotzdem super-komfortabel. Von vielen Zimmern gute Aussicht.
- Unterhaltung: Gut besuchte Bar mit vielen Sitzgelegenheiten
- Personal: Immer sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Definitiv nicht das snobige Verhalten, welches man teilweise in anderen W-Hotels antrifft.
Fazit: Immer gerne wiederWe got a decent price on a standard room with a king bed ($175 before taxes) and stayed a night just after Christmas. The service was impeccable—from bell hops (do they still call them that?) to the concierge (Sean was really helpful). 
The decor was gorgeous and the location was perfect-close to shops and restaurants. 
Excellent hotel- highly recommended!Ein Super Hotel in Downtown Seattle für Leute die eine Städte-Trip unternehmen! Sehr gut gelegen, Hafen 5 Blocks, Einkaufsmeile 5 Blocks, alle Buslinien in unmittelbarer Nähe, Monorail 4 Blocks, also alles was sich Downtown und Belltown abspielt ist gut zu Fuß zu erreichen. Ausstattung absolut gut, Zimmer, Lobby, Bar, Restaurant schönes Design, als wir da waren Mittwoch und Samstag ein DJ in der Bar (Housemusik). Alles an zusätzlichen Service Möglichkeiten gegeben, ansonsten kümmert sich der Conzierge darum. Also wir sind auf unserem Weg von Vancouver über Vancouver Island nach Seattle gekommen, und es war mit Abstand das beste und Preislich angemessenste Hotel auf dem Trip, wir würden und werden weitere Hotels dieser Gruppe ausprobieren.シアトルの中心部にあり、非常に便利。部屋も清潔でおしゃれ。何部屋か見せてもらったけれども、一番安い部屋でも十分満喫できるはず。レストランも最高に美味しかった。ラウンジも感じよく、飴やドーナツとフリードリンクが用意されている。あまり大きくないホテルなのでチェックインチェックアウトも大混雑せずにスムーズ。Das W Hotel in Seattle ist für mich die erste Adresse vor Ort! Das ganze ambiente vor Ort ist extrem stylish, angefangen von der großzügigen Lobby mit Kamin bis hin zu den wunderschönen Zimmern! Die Betten sind ein Traum - wenn man sich hineinlegt fühlt man sich wie in eine weiche Wolke gepackt. Die Lage des Hotels ist optimal - nur ca 5-10 Minuten zu Fuß bis zum Public Market oder den Shopping Möglichkeiten. Das Frühstück im Hotel ist recht teuer - aber direkt gegenüber gibt es einen Starbucks als alternative.""W""のイメージを求めて宿泊すると、正直、期待はずれでがっかりします。
一見するとモダンに見えますが、全体として醸し出す雰囲気は「洗練」とはほど遠いものです。
内装、サービス、レストランの味、ファシリティ等、どれをとっても驚きは皆無で、全てが可もなく不可もなくといった水準です。そこそこカッコよくまとめられた小ぎれいなビジネスホテルといった印象です。
その割には価格が高すぎると思うので、個人的にはお勧めできません。
立地は悪くないと思います。W Hotelは、どの都市でも素晴らしいのですが、ここシアトルでもレベルの高いサービスを提供してくれます。
入口に段差があるのが難点ですが、ドアマンがフォローしてくれます。
内装は落ち着いていてとてもくつろげます。
レストランも美味しいですよ。Ben er nu 5 keer geweest, en elke keer is het bevallen. De atmosfeer is heel relaxed en voel me er zo onderhand thuis... Is dat goed of slecht?少し早めに着いてしまいましたが、気持ちよくチェックインに応じてくれました。なかなかシックですみずみまで目の行き届いたホテルという感じです。近くの部屋に騒がしい子供たちがいたので、部屋を変更してもらいましたが、その時のスタッフの対応もよかったです。だいぶ早めに着いてしまったのですが、気持ちよくアーリーチェックインに応じてくれました。廊下がえらく暗い印象でした。部屋は眺めもよく、きれいに整えられなかなかよかったです。ただ、しばらくすると隣室でしょうか子供たちの騒ぎ声がけっこう大きく聞こえてきました。一流ホテルとしては防音がちょっと寂しい状態でしたね。フロントにその旨連絡するとすぐに部屋を取り替えてくれました、対応はさすがWというかんじですね。全体としては合格点でしょうか。hôtel luxe design standard , pas de décoration extraordinaire , mais du simple beau design chaleureux.
très bonne literie.
très bien situé dans le centre ville.
Wifi payant 15 dollars la journée.
Attention , les chambre avec une vue extraordinaire ( nous étions au 14eme) , n'ont que le nom d'extraordinaire, l 'hôtel étant entouré d autre building la vue reste sur d'autre immeuble .... c est un peu survendu. reste à voir les tous derniers étage ??ホテル内のインテリア等は他のWと同じ様なものですが、ちょっとボロくなっているなと思われる所がありました。ソファーがほころびていたりしました。学生等がパーティーした結果でしょうか。。。Ich kann nur aufgreifen was meine Vorredner erwähnt haben: klasse Lage (5 Blocks vom Wasser entfernt im Ortskern), coole Einrichtung (Ipod Dockingstation, großer Fernseher, DVD Player, Wlan), es ist gut was los in der Bar/Lounge, Zimmer absolut sauber und Personal sehr freundlich.
Nachteilig ist das teure Valet Parking (35 $), aber so ist das halt in amerikanischen Großstädten.
Als wir da waren hatte sie in Kooperation mit einer Autofirma einen kostenlosen Shuttleservice für die ganze Innenstadt. Das Angebot wird aber wahrscheinlich nur temorär sein."
100597,Doubletree by Hilton Seattle Airport,3.5,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60878-d100597-Reviews-Doubletree_by_Hilton_Seattle_Airport-Seattle_Washington.html,,WA,18740 International Boulevard,98188,Seattle,3.5416012558869703,3.7629513343799057,3.32967032967033,2.6781789638932496,3.230769230769231,"This place is like a bad 1980's hotel. As a HH Gold member it is embarrassing that Hilton would own given motelish feel with remote buildings. Very dated carpets, cold hallways, and a goofy entrance with gates. Doubletree are feeling like the old Holidomes. Not as close to airport as other hotels.Nice hotel that's very convenient to SEATAC airport. The only negative is the long wait for transportation.
Other than that, nice quiet rooms with comfortable bed, nice workout facility.
Two hotel restaurants that are quite good but also several restaurants within walking distance from the front door.Had a quick overnight on the way to Airport & highway. As usual the chocolate chip cookie on checkin was nice. The room was very large & comfy. The only down side was that although I was put in an upgraded room, it was a looonng way away from checkin & it was a bit of a haul. This is a very convenient location to Seattle airport (and nearby mall) if you have an early flight. Hotel also had a shuttle over tothe mall which I took advantage of.Stayed one night here due to flight connections in October 2012. 
The hotel is clean and comfortable. The airport shuttle works well. Check in was fast and efficient. Room was also spacious and they had supplied a rollaway in advance per my request which was helpful. Nice bar area with friendly staff. 
I have Hilton Gold. Some properties give away a full breakfast, others do not. I understand this. There are a lot of people with this status and the hotel has to make a profit. At this hotel I was given a voucher to the in house cafe, worth $16 I think. This is fine. However, there are no prices on anything in the cafe. FYI, the coffee is $4. In addition the staff were indifferent. The choice is limited and of course with the kids as well, you will be spending money for breakfast. Just be aware.I had a Really LONG Wait getting picked up at shuttle area. Not sure why but I waited 57 minutes ON Oxygen for health reasons in the cold.
Needless to say ...I was Very Upset when I arrived at the Hotel ... Then I met Ryan Murray .. What a Class Act this guy is !! He listened to me and apologised with the Greatest of Sincerity. He upgraded me to
a Very Nice Room and Bought me Dinner as well ... I have told everyone about his caring and attention ... GREAT JOB Ryan Murray
Thanks Hilton for Hiring this Guy ... Karen Martin . Boise IdahoWe stayed here before an early flight abroad. Check in was fast and the staff was very pleasant. Our room was really large, clean, and with a huge deck (which would have been nice in the summer), and a big bath with lots of high-end bath products. We took the shuttle to the nearby Hilton (associated) for dinner. (That was an experience that needs its own review, the food and service were so fabulous). The shuttle driver was polite and the van was clean and warm. There was a bit of a walk to the elevator to get to our room, but we didn't need to go outside at all, which was nice considering the weather in Seattle. The room had a nice living room/TV area, so it would have been OK for a family. The bed was comfortable and we got our 3 AM wake-up call as requested. They had a nice Keurig-type coffee maker, so it wasn't the typical crappy hotel in-room coffee. This was nice since there was no coffee in the lobby in the morning. THe shuttle that dropped us at the airport was warm and the driver was pretty cordial, considering the hour. Overall, would highly recommend this hotel. Not sure how it would be in the summer but I think it had a pool, so the kids would be happy. It looked like it had some nice, smaller restaurant options and a coffee bar, but it wasn't open at 4 AM.The staff is very nice and helpful. Our kids were impressed with the staff handed out the hot cookies at check-in counter. 
Our room was in the main tower so and too much walking for us. The size of the room is quite big and nice. The beds are quite comfortable. However, I will not book this hotel again even if there is a special rate due to the extra charges. In the same class hotel in the area, there are free internet in the room and the self-parking fee is much lower.
These are the fees that I unfortunately found out afterward (my bad...booked the room in a rush).
Fee for in-room wireless Internet: USD 14.95 (for 24 hours, rates may vary)
Fee for in-room high-speed Internet (wired): USD 14.95 (for 24 hours, rates may vary)
Self parking fee: USD 21 per night (in/out privileges)
Valet parking fee: USD 26 per night (in/out privileges)
Pet deposit: USD 50 per stay
Refrigerator fee: USD 15 per night
Rollaway bed fee: USD 25 per nightHas the usual high standard for Doubletree facilities and staff. Our tower room had a fine view, and the airport shuttles were comfortable and ran on time. The tower section is not for the navigationaly impaired: It is a long and confusing trek involving long corridors, walkways and elevators to reach the lobby and restaurant area.Comfortable and convenient from SeaTac with shuttle that comes by every 20 min. Rooms clean and updated. Free Internet is only available in lobby-otherwise it cost a pretty penny as well as no free breakfast. Everything comes at a cost in the big city. Dave's Diner within walking distance provides suitable breakfast for slightly cheaper than hotel. Parking here is also an additional cost so if you're only staying near airport for 1 night, get your rental car the next day (if you're just coming into SeaTac) or drop it off and catch a shuttle back to hotel (if you're leaving the next day).One of the larger Doubletree properties you will find. Conveniently located across the street from Seatac airport. The staff here is very nice but not the most efficient. The last few times I checked in, I asked for a package that was delivered to be sent up to my room. I had to call down hours later each time to remind them that I was still waiting for the package. It's understandable considering how busy it can get there; however, be a little proactive and don't wait if you need something right away.
Being right on the strip there are plenty of restaurants nearby but I wouldn't eat anywhere around. You can find plenty of great restaurants in Burien and South Center without all the airport crowds.Checking in was a breeze as a HHonors member and then came the instructions on how to get to the room. This involved up and down two different elevators, finding a skybridge and then wandering down angling corridors - to eventually find our room. The fact that 4 out of 5 guests we ran into on the way to the room were lost or confused suggests that the architect did not have simplicity at the top of his/her list. 
While the soup in the restaurant was quite tasty, and the chocolate chip cookie at check-in was a nice gesture - I was sorely disappointed, however, when I finally got ready for bed and tried to turn on the TV. No luck - even after the technician showed up and tried to get it to work. He needed to change the power system to get it to run. We were tired and frustrated - then went to turn on our laptops to find that we would get charged for each device. To give the evening front desk staff credit - they comped our internet.
I have the sense that this is older hotel and should be scheduled for a retrofit. Electrical outlets not located for 21st century - but they did have a power bar on the floor by the desk.
The hotel is close to the airport - but so are a number of other hotels - with working TVs.
I've stayed at a number of hotels around Seatac and this is not on my recommended list.This is a very nice hotel, and the front staff was excellent. If you can, get a room in the tower, those rooms have a great view! Room service deliveryperson was friendly and efficient! WiFi is a bit slow, especially if a bunch of people hook up at the same time.Stayed over to catch 6:30am flight
1. Air vent kept clicking all night making me think someone was at door
2. Paid for parking at check in, then had to pay at machine at exit as well
3. Unable to sleep because I was the dinner buffet for some sort of bugs. I believe they were in the bed covering due to the location of the bites. All along my 'chest' and on the underside of my upper arms. 
Now I am afraid to put my sleepwear in my suitcase.This Hotel used to be my favorite in the SeaTac area, but the service seems to go down tremendously.
Shuttle bus will not bring you to the Light Rail anymore.
The complimentary ""Continental Breakfast"" turned into a $10 voucher, now this has even been downgraded into an $8 voucher to be used at the cold and draughty Espresso Bar area.
A little attention for HH Diamond members - gone.
Wifi is advertised, but the speed is poor.
Request for a certain floor level - ignored.
Substantial party noise on the floor during the night: ""We are so sorry""
Unfortunately I cannot recommend this Hotel to friends anymore and will stay in other fantastic Hotels in the area with outstanding service, just minutes away.We travelled to Bouchard Gardens, crossed via ferry to Victoria Island in Canada. Took two buses to Bouchard Gardens and got great tour of their splendid gardens. Stayed three nights
and each night was more fascinating than the one before it. Their desk staff was extremely accomodating and they were well trained Concierges. Just a short walk from the Hotel is the Light Rail that takes to see Mount Ranier, Sea Hawks Statium and Shopping in downtown Seattle. Car Rental and hotel stay were arranged through Hotwire.com and savings were great.
A must see when you were in Seattle was Saint Anne's, we visited the Tower which is an Icon for the City of Seattle and they have Glass Blowing Foundary and the workers were extremely friendly. Seattle and the Surrounding Countryside are an excellent Vacation and when you see the Pike's Public market with all the freshest Catches from the sea and he assortment of Cheeeses you will love this stay. Your only question that will be un answered when you leave, is when can i come back and see it again.Another couple and my wife and I spent the night at this Doubletree as our flight from Sea-Tac airport departed quite early the next morning. From the moment we approached the desk and were greated by one of the friendliest desk clerks we've met, through the time we had to depart the next morning, we felt relaxed. We have stayed at places more expensive than this place that weren't nearly as relaxing. The patrons sitting in the bar were even friendly! Our rooms were rather spacious for what we asked for, just for the one night. Not sure what more anyone could ask for: clean and spacious rooms, comfortable both in and out of the beds, and color schemes set to help us relax.We stayed at this hotel on November 6, 2012 because we had an early morning flight to Las Vegas and didn't want to compete with Seattle traffic. We checked in around 7 pm. Check was good, our hotel room was far away from the lobby. This hotel has ""pods"" so you might have a long walk to get to your room. It was the evening of the presidential election and our television didn't work! I called the front desk and maintenance showed up right away. They brought a TV from a different hotel room and switched out ours, took about 30 minutes. The maintenance men were very nice. 
I'm always cold and our room would not heat up, I finally took a really hot shower to shake that cold feeling. While the maintenance men were fixing our TV, they looked at the heater as well but couldn't make it warmer. 
Other than the TV and the heater, the beds were comfortable. The shuttle was on time, running every 20 minutes to the airport. I thought it was a pretty good value, I got the rooms on-line with the early/non-refundable rate.I chose the Hilton Doubletree Seatac Airport because it had a free shuttle to the airport. I had a 5am flight and the Doubletree had great free shuttle times to get me to the airport on time. This hotel was also close to the metro train to get into and out of Seattle. Check in was fast and my room was clean. This hotel had a nice on site Starbucks and a late night restaurant. The late night menu was very expensive and I could not bring myself to order because the prices were so outrageous. I'll pay good money for good food, but that was a simple late night menu. I'm glad I did not have a rental car because the prices they wanted to park were obscene and clearly taking advantage of the guest. The hotel had a nice outdoor heated pool and hot tub that was being used by a ton of children, so I didn't get a chance to use the spa area. There was a large band camp going on for high schoolers so the hotel was filled with kids. I note this because the hotel was very quiet considering. The hotel staff did a good job making sure the children were not a bother to the other guests. My room was clean and spacious. The shower area was nice and had a lot of counter space. My room also had a very large balcony. Over all I'd stay here again. I just wouldn't park a car or eat at the restaurant.We choose to park and fly so the valet wasn't an extra cost. Decent cost to meet our objective. Check in was easy and I think the reason they give you the cookie is so you have a snack on the way to your room because now comes the hard part..........a very long walk to our room. My mom is 83 and she had to stop numerous times prior to us arriving at building 5. The room was clean and well laid out. Service was excellent: We took the shuttle to the airport and they came out to us to pickup so we didn't have to make the trek. Very nice bell man and accommodating.We arrived late in the evening and everyone was really nice, although the front desk person seemed a little annoyed when I asked for a second cookie for my wife. Could have been a long day for her, no harm no foul.
GOOD
We got a room close to the lobby (but even the porter was telling us how hard it was to get to some rooms).
It was clean.
We had asked for extra pillows and they were there.
NOT SO GOOD
The shower's water pressure was pathetic, so was the shower curtain.
The bathroom was in disrepair.
A little bit of a funky odor (cleared up by opening the window).
They advertise that the airport shuttle runs every 15 minutes, but at 6:30A there was no bus there and we were told it would be 20-30 minutes before the next bus. If you were rushed for a flight and depending on them, this would have been stressful.
The staff at the coffee stand in the lobby could not have cared about what they were doing less.We stayed here for a few nights last weekend, booked on expedia's ""surprise me"" plan so we were committed. 
The room was fairly musty and probably was a smoking room in the past. Internet was and up-charge, and I gave up on ever getting a coffee in lobby in the mornings as the singly staffed coffee bar was always backed up.
The two good things I can say about the place is at least the bed was comfortable and the airplane noise was surprisingly quiet for being so close to the airport.
Oh yeah, one other good thing... It's right by the Cedarbrook Lodge (where we wanted to stay) which has a fantastic restaurant, the Copperleaf. One of the BEST meals we've had in a while.The hotel is spread out and you could be walking a long way to room -- not ideal if you are tired. Also, parking is $23/night. I think that is a bit crazy for a non-downtown hotel. The room was clean and surprisingly quiet given it's location to airport. Once I got to the room it was a nice night's sleep.Should the room one gets depend on the price paid or should the hotel offer a consistent experience for all guests? The rating depends on your answer to this question. My assumption is that I am buying ""the brand"" and should expect the service regardless of what I pay. If the experience is worth it I will come back at full rate. Front desk was not very friendly.
 The bed was comfortable, the tub was cracked, the faucet dripped. Parking was $21 per day (the lot was fairly empty). There was no free Internet in the room. Why is it that the more you spend on a hotel the more additional fees there are for services that are free at ""lower"" brand hotels. Stayed at the Hampton last time ( just a short block away) and would stay at the Hampton again.So as a10-year Hilton Honor Diamond Member, ""continental breakfast"" is included. At virtually 100% of Hilton properties this means a ""real"" breakfast -- a hot, sit-down (almost always buffet) breakfast. Not here. At this property it means an $8 voucher for the Expresso Cafe. Continental breakfast by definition is AT LEAST coffee, muffin/bread/roll, and juice. To most ""nicer"" hotels (anything not a motel) it includes fruit and oatmeal and at ""finer"" hotels like true Hiltons, Waldorfs, and Conrads, it includes all breakfast items. The basic coffee, bread, and juice at the Expresso Cafe cannot be had for close to $8. We were told this change in policy came from the Operations Manager. Bad operations decision.....especially for repeat Diamond corporate customers. On matter of principle and not hunger, we will not go back and will not recommend to colleagues who travel to the SeaTac area often.The hotel could use an update. Apparently, ""building one"" was quite nice and we were offered an upgrade for an additional $50. Our room, the hotel itself was clean and orderly. We used the fitness room which was well equipped and had towels and a water dispenser. 
Our room was clean, the beds were comfortable, hot water and pressure was good and the air flow was good. 
 Poor customer service and being nickel and dimed is my gripe. $15 for internet to your room ( free in the lobby); $23 for parking ( go across the street instead).
The remote in our room did not work and after 5 failed attempts with the front desk, we gave up waiting for it; asked them to leave it at the front desk and went out for dinner instead. Front desk demeanor was trite and unwelcoming. I felt unacknowledged in a timely manner. Very poor customer service left a bad taste in my mouth.... Management, if you are reading this, get it fixed.The room was spacious, updated, and even had a balcony. The shuttle to the airport was convenient and had plenty of room for multiple travelers. The shuttle made the train trip into the city easy, as you access the train at the airport. Seating in the lobby and public areas was cozy. Staff were friendly and attentive (but there were no cookies when we checked in).We attended a four day convention here. The hotel is nice, tucked away but close to the SeaTac airport. 24 hour shuttles and a cookie at check-in makes it even better. The rooms are large enough to accommodate any size luggage. The dresser ample and there is a good size closet. We had the two queen bed option which the balcony overlooked the parking lot (not exciting). The beds were comfy. Flat panel television with a varied array of channels. The hot tub and pool area were nice although we felt it was too cold outside to partake a number of the other attendees made use of it. We had a later flight on our final day here and had to check out way before. The hotel was graciously accommodating holding our luggage while we traveled to downtown Seattle for a day trip. The in-house restaurants were a tad bit pricey which had us off property for the majority of our meals. Luckily there are a number of restaurants close by although we had to ferret these out on our own.All in all with just one hiccup (maid forgot to clean our room the first day) this is a yes kind of place. Preferentially we would stay somewhere downtown but for this particular trip it was perfect.You might find an inexpensive room here, but make sure you include breakfast ($27) and parking ($23). Not even internet was included in my stay ($15)... it get's expensive!
Everything is clean and works well, but the hotel is somehow dark and seems worn down. I did not get the same feeling as I got at Doubletree in Amsterdam where everything seemed new and modern. 
You get the cookie when you check in, but a smile is not included.Convenient to airport, nice staff, big airport shuttle bus.
Prefer newer tower for my stays- rooms are nicer and more convenient to lobby, restaurant, shuttle. 
Older part smells musty, room was cold, & a long walk to restaurant, shuttle, coffee. I did not like staying in the older part of the hotel.
Love the restaurant and bar. Have had same staff numerous stays and they are very friendly and nice.
I usually stay at this Doubletree when we have early morning departures.This was a very nice hotel overall...design layout was very unique...more like a resort hotel...had a very long walk to romm and back to lobby area. Elevator was ""outside"" the structure and it was very cold to ride! Extremely convenient to the airport ...just a few blocks away. Shuttle service was also very convenient...even available to take guests to local dining. Hallway temperature was very chilly (stayed there in October). My room was a lake view...very relaxing to come back to the room an watch the ducks! Very good food in the hoytel restaurant.Passing through Seattle on the way to the east coast, we usually stay at the Doubletree Suites at Southcenter. However, inexplicably, our reservation there was overtaken by events and we ended up being ""walked"" to the other Doubletree facility at Sea-Tac. The manager from the hotel that walked us came in the van with the driver and personally apologized for this oversight. He explained that arrangements had been made for us to stay overnight at the Doubletree by Hilton Seattle Airport at no cost to us, in an upgraded room, with a 30,000-point bonus in my HHonors account. We accepted the deal and were quickly transported to the alternate hotel.
I had stayed here years before, when it was still a Red Lion. Our room, which did not appear to be an upgrade, was in the tower on the 12th floor. The porter who helped us with our bags explained that the tower had recently been renovated, and that statement seemed to be true. The furnishings and finishings were indeed different (and newer) than I remembered them. Other than that, it was a standard room. Clean, comfortable, and somewhat quiet (our room faced the airport and the associated noise was sometimes audible).
We enjoyed dinner in the Seaport Lounge. Wife had the hummus and broccolini. I had a shrimp caesar salad and an order of buffalo wings. I ordered a glass of Alaskan Pale and got served a glass of IPA. Who knew? I like them both, so no problem.
This hotel is inferior to the Suites in terms of HHonors Gold benefits in that you only get an $8 credit at the coffee stand in the lounge for breakfast (if you have your MyWay preferences so set). At the Suites, Golds get a full hot buffet.
It was nice to revisit an ""old friend"" but next time we will go back to the Doubletree Suites. Indeed, the Suites manager told me to let him know when we'd be staying there next so we could be well taken care of. I advised him that we would be doing so in nine days. It remains to be seen how well that stay goes but he will get his chance to make good on his word.Hotel is a typical airport hotel - very large and many rooms. I was booked there because Lufthansa flight attendants choosed to go on strike. Large shuttle bus for about 25 people. I got a room on the uppermost floor which was very nice and large- Enough space and also very clean. Extremely comfortable King size bed! Ordinary coffee machine however - nothing fancy here. The view was so so. Had a balcony but i did not choose to use it. Very nice outdoor pool and sunning area. The restaurant at the hotel however is small, not many tables and very expensive. Would not eat there if i would not have to.Having previously stayed in the hilton --we tried the Doubletree. Efficient shuttle -very quiet --no airport noise and with Sound Transit At $5.90 for day return it was a cheaper alternative to Downtown Seattle. Good breakfast and friendly staff. Would stay again.Quick Points:
- You must pay for Internet (I believe it was about $15 for a day), Parking ($23 per day) and Breakfast.
- There are other hotels in the area that offers Internet, Parking and Breakfast for free which irked me.
- Hotel offered airport parking for non hotel residents for less than $10 per day, which irked me more.
This hotel is very close to the airport, surrounded by trees and there was a lake. Pool is outdoors.
When we first checked in, we received warm welcome cookies. It was a nice touch. I expected my room to be in the tall building, but I didn't know this hotel was also apartment/resort style. I have a picture of the hotel layout (see below). Our room was big, clean and spacious. The problem I had was that to get to the bar and all, we had to walk all the way from where we were to the main building (see my pics below). At least the gym was conveniently nearby. The workout equipment were in excellent condition and water and towels were available for our convenience. 
We went to the bar on a Friday night, and there weren't too many people there. I was a little put off by how they treated us though. There were 2 bartenders and 2 servers. We wanted to get our drinks and sit by the fireplace, not the bar. But this bar wasn't designed like a normal bar where a person can walk up and order a drink so everyone working kept telling us different things. Then one bartender checked our ID's and left. The other one took my order and then stared at me and looked clueless. I told him the other bartender checked our IDs and he said ok and left. There was no place for me to stand so I had to sit, and when I did the servers came and I had to explain what was going on to them. 3 drinks cost us $50.
Housekeeping was great, and did a through job. 
We stayed 4 days, and paid $92 for parking. Then my brother pointed out that the hotel offers airport parking for non residents the rate was less than $10 per day.
Hotel was clean, area was safe, and we were comfortable. This place would be excellent if didn't have ridiculous fees for everything.
Since I have a choice, I will not stay here again.Very Poor customer service with regards to cancelling a reseveration. The Hotel food and staff very pleasent. Beware of the cancellation charge. They do not tell you when you cancel that your credit will be charged nor do they send you a bill. Also the parking fee is a shock.Arriving at 11:30 pm, we waited for the shuttle only 2 minutes. This was luck, but the shuttle is scheduled every 15 minutes 24 hours a day, and when I called the day before to check on the schedule, the helpful clerk asked if I were at the airport, and if so, she could use their GPS to see where the shuttle was. Except for the newer tower, the rest of the hotel is fairly old, a series of four-story wings meant to evoke northwest native long houses, connected with sky bridges and nicely landscaped. If mobility is an issue, be sure to ask for something close. We had almost a 5-minute walk to get to our room--and were glad that the front desk had given us a map. The room was comfortable, quiet, large, and looked out on a small lake. At least the wi-fi in the lobby was free. If quick-access to the airport is important, and you don't mind a hike to your room--and, like us, you paid Priceline rates--this can be a good choice.I must say the biggest thing I didn't like about this hotel was no free wifi & also the $23 fee to park every night. The website says $21 + tax so with the tax it was $46 to just park for two nights. So it makes the deal you think you received seem not so great. It was especially irritating to see them advertising airport parking for non hotel guests at half the price and you could've parked across the road for like $11 but had a nice sized walk ahead of you. Also 24 hours of wifi cost you $14.95 and if you wanted 1 hour then it cost $4.95. I've never been to this area before but every other airport I stay near has free wifi so if you are traveling on business this doesn't sound that appealing.
But aside from that the stay was OK. As somebody said earlier, it has a crazy layout and the amount of space this hotel covers is massive. We were in building 5 which was the farthest away from the lobby and it was at least a 5 minute brisk walk to the actual lobby. Other than all of this we slept well and the area seemed safe. If I had a choice in the future it would be to avoid this hotel as there are plenty of other options right down the road from here.Check-in was quick. There is a small sign for Hilton Honors check in; and although there wasn't someone at the counter specifically manning the Honors check-ins, as soon as we showed up we were quickly attended to. We had a tower room, which was very spacious with comfortable bed. 
Just two complaints/suggestions: (1) regarding breakfast, as Hilton Gold members we were given $8 coupons for the Starbucks kiosk in the lobby. There are no prices listed for the coffee or food items. So we didn't know if we could buy coffee only, muffins, or whatever. After picking up coffee and muffin, the cashier would say, ""OK, you spent only (such and such). You can also get a granola bar or piece of fruit."" It would be nice to have the prices posted so people know what they are paying for. (2) the music in the lobby was extremely loud.
The shuttle bus was very convenient and was a quick ride to the airport. We would stay here again.This hotel is great in many ways - free shuttle to the airport, free shuttle to the local shopping mall, great staff, good food, nice breakfast and dining areas and really nice rooms. However, the layout of the hotel is crazy! It is eight different buildings attached to each other via a series of ""skybridges"". Just to get to my room in Building 4, I had to go down a long skybridge 1, take an elevator up one level, walk down two more long skybridges, take an elevator down one level and walk across one more skybridge! This is no fun when you are pushing a luggage cart full of suitcases. Once in the room, we found that the electric outlets did not work and neither did the shower. The staff quickly got those working. All in all, a good hotel, just request a room in Building 1.I often stay overnight at the nearby Airport Hilton and Conference Center when traveling through Seatac. However, this time the Hilton was fully booked and I stayed, for the first time, at the Doubletree. Never again.
The bed was quite comfortable, but in other ways the Doubletree just didn't measure up.
--Check-in: The reception desk was chaotic and understaffed with no special provisions for Hilton Honors members, aside from the sign on the desk. There was just one long line. I did get a Doubletree cookie, though.
--Food and beverage: The restaurant/bar felt like a brightly lit coffee shop and was devoid of atmosphere. I don't necessarily expect that, but I do expect quality food and a pleasant, efficient wait staff. After first being brought the wrong order, I was served a barely edible hamburger that I chose from the very limited menu available at 10 p.m., not terribly late for an airport hotel. The wait staff seemed to be carrying on some longstanding argument with each other and spent most of their time insulting each other. When they chose to serve customers, there were no smiles, just frowns and grumpy monosyllables. Prices were about average for hotel bar/restaurants and the martini, while small, was well made.
--The room: As I said, the bed was great, one of the best I've slept in at a hotel. The room was large, but the bathroom area could use some renovation.This is a large hotel and it can be a long walk to your room.
--Location: Yes, it's close to the airport and has frequent shuttles, but it's surrounded by huge parking lots and is much less convenient than the nearby Hilton, which is a 15-minute walk from the terminal through the light-rail station.
--Checkout: I always use Hilton's Zipout Checkout, but at the Doubletree my bill was not placed under my door in the morning. I had to call the front desk to make sure the charges were correct and they sent a copy of the bill through email. It was a good thing I was using 3G on my iPad, so I didn't have to pay $14 for Internet access.
--The ""atmosphere:"" This is an intangible area but an important one. Weary travelers --especially those who stay near airports--are looking for a comfortable, welcoming refuge. This Doubletree felt like I was still in the airport: Long, brightly lit corridors; impersonal, unsmiling and probably overworked staff; indifferent (actually, pretty bad) food; surly wait staff. 
Yes, this is a large hotel that serves a lot of people every day. I know it's never going to have ""charm."" But the Hilton up the street does a much better job of serving a similarly large number of customers with better food and a more personable, welcoming staff.
Great bed at the Doubletree, though, which is why this visit rates three stars instead of two.Stayed here last week overnight on the way to the Oregon Coast. Walk-in rate of $119 for a two-Queen room with a view of the pond turned into $169 after wireless fee, parking fee, and taxes. Hairs in the bathtub, and the toilet looked like it hadn't been scrubbed in a while.And by EVERYTHING I mean parking ($31/day) and Internet ($15/24 hours), plus dirty dishes sit in the hallway for DAYS!
I checked in on a Thursday and as of this writing on Saturday night, there has been a dirty plate sitting in the hallway. Both Friday and Saturday afternoons the rooms were cleaned. I don't know if it's a competition in laziness for employees or what, but it is a bit ridiculous.
Would I stay here again? Probably not.I stayed at this hotel because Doubletrees typically are nice hotels and this is by far, a nice hotel.
The hotel shuttle - When arriving at the airport and never stayed at doubletree before, be aware there is a doubletree suites and doubletree both near each other and each running it's own shuttles. This one operates 30 passenger small coach buses which is perfect for the size of the hotel. This hotel was VERY BUSY the saturday night I was there recently and I can see why. Beautiful hotel, updated, very comfortable firm beds, and clean room. A small 10-12 passenger vehicle would not do the job unless there were 2 shuttles. These shuttles ran non-stop when I arrived and I didnt even have to call for a ride, it just shows up. I took the shuttle back to SEATAC to go downtown and it just runs on demand. Very convenient. When returning from downtown, I just waited 10 minutes and then it came as it makes continuous shuttles day and night, atleast when I was there. I'm not sure calling the hotel would help seeing it makes consistent runs. On check out, it runs every 20 minutes in the morning and promptly.
Room is clean, comfortable, and BIG. 2 double bed room, felt like a suite in some other places i've been. Definitely a nice value for the price. Plus the warm cookie on check in yummy.
Restaurant, I did look at the menu but I never really eat in hotel restaurants anyway. The pricing is comparable to other hotel restaurants and all about convenience - pricewise. I recommend to eat across the street where there is a Jack in the Box, Denny's, Subway, and a couple other places. There are gas stations across the street to save a few pennies for sodas/juices. 
I will definitely stay here again. Convenient, close to the airport, great for getting to/from downtown, and comfortable room.The hotel is less than a mile from the airport and is great when you have to catch an early flight. The site is easy to find from the freeway and when you want to go to the airport, you just go out the front and turn right. If you have a high room facing the airport, you can see the planes take off and arriving. However, with the door shut, we could not hear them. The restaurant is part sports bar. That doesn't detract from it and the food was good. I am not pleased with what is apparently Doubletree, if not Hilton, policy about charging guests for the privilege of parking their own cars.We are Diamond Hilton members and regularly stay at Doubletrees. So when making a stopover on our 4000 miles journey to Fairbanks at Seattle we booked the Airport Doubletree. We won't again. The Shuttle is a coach, far to big, and therefore infrequent. A fleet of smaller minivans would provide quicker and more comfortable service. We were upgraded and the room was very comfortable with a tremendous shower. But no newspaper was delivered next morning and the breakfast was a disgrace-we had to use a Starbucks Cafe to receive our complimentary breakfast-uncooked and valued at $8! We are used to a cooked breakfast on the house, and receive it at other Doubletrees. The Manager I spoke with could not care less. Fortubately there are other Hilton brands nearby so they will receive our patronage. Oh and the printing did not work either from bedroom or in Business Center, indeed the internet connectioin was slow and intermittent.3 of us arrived for convention and although the hotel and rooms are nice we were shocked at the nickel and diming. The lounge is over priced and as that is the only place for dinner there should be a better menu and better pricing. We moved hotels after 2 nights. We were not fortunate to meet the "" great staff"", we did not get cookies upon checking in. Could not get a luggage cart and the staff member valet just walked away. The staff at the Starbucks is very nice. Our biggest complaint was the WiFi, $14 per per room is one thing, but per device is disgusting! At $9 per glass of wine we were not about to spend our evenings in the Lobby to get our work done. Holiday Inn Express! Free shuttle, free wifi, free breakfast, free parking .. Great staff!This is a very nice hotel. Everything is top notch. Also, it is a huge hotel. The reading chair was comfortable which was nice. The bed was very comfortable. The airport shuttle runs 24 hours a day. The shuttle leaves every 20 minutes (top of the hour, 20 past the hour and 40 past the hour). The staff is very friendly. The price was only $119 a night. I stayed in room 511. This room does not overlook the airport. It was really quiet in my room. I believe that all rooms have a balcony. I didn't hear much noise. There is a business center on the 2nd floor with 3 computers to get on the Internet and print. The only thing that I didn't like is having to pay for in-room WiFi. I don't understand why some of the high-end hotels charge for in-room WiFi. The low-end hotels don't charge for it. I have stayed at the Doubletree in downtown Milwaukee and I wasn't charged for in-room WiFi. Also, they charge for parking. The La Quinta across the street has free parking so I'm not sure why they are charging for parking.I loved this hotel for the simple fact that it had a fantastic gym - or gyms. I was at a convention for work and I work with a lot of people who care about their health and regularly work out, and I never found myself waiting to use a machine, weights, etc. Also, the rooms are very nice and quiet and the service from the staff was great. I would definitely stay here again. The only thing that isn't great is the location. It's about a 30-40 min ride to downtown Seattle, but then again, we were there for work, not to enjoy the city. Nice stay either way.We stayed here four years ago after departing an Alaskan cruise in Vancouver and flying out of Seattle the following day. We enjoyed it so much that we did not hesitate to book the Doubletree again this trip. We arrived before lunch time and had an early flight out the next morning to Seward, Alaska. We got to the front desk at 5:00a.m. the next morning and the shuttle had already left. A bell captain drove us to the airport, which we 
very, very much appreciated. We would have missed our flight without his help.
This hotel is perfect for airport travel. Very nice accommodations, restaurants and convient shuttle service.
I will always stay here!This is our 2nd stay here with everything excellent .. except no fans in the bathroom .. beds are so so so comfy and slept great too .. breakfast cafe was extremely prepared quick with a great variety of food for all .. large shuttle bus .. cookies to chew on while registering .. definately recommend as a very convenient hotel for an early morning take-off!!! Yes .. hotel is huge with a bit of a walk to rooms which is good for privacy .. nice work out area and pool for a long stay!!! Good restaurants in area to go to as hotel food pricey!!!We stayed here at the beginning and end of our trip to the Pacific Northwest, because it was near the airport and we had a late flight in and an early flight out. This hotel more than met our expectations. Clean, comfortable, and extremely convenient. The shuttle to and from the airport was fast, efficient, and timely. We ate at the restaurant for breakfast and dinner. The food was good and prices were reasonable. Check-in was easy, and there is nothing like a warm cookie to make your arrival more pleasant. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay near the airport.The good: This is an older but well maintained Hilton property, so you can expect a decent stay with no major problems. Rooms were quite nice with comfy beds and quality linens. The hotel is literally across the street from the Seattle airport so it is convenient. Another bonus is the fact that this hotel sells a ton of rooms through priceline for very low rates. Bid there to get the best deal, and save 50% or more off your stay. We got a very low price on the hotel itself, comparable with the local ""Super 6"" kinda motels, and a much better room of course. 
Now, the bad: They do their very best to nickel and dime you to death. Parking is a moderately outrageous $21 per night. There is a fee for internet access. Breakfast will run you about $15 for a couple eggs and some toast. Upon checkin, we informed the front desk that we would only be parking for one night, not the second night of our stay. We were assured that we would only be charged for one night. Well, you guessed it, we got charged for two nights. They fixed it but it's still annoying. The staff was okay, but not the most friendly you'll ever encounter. Finally, this hotel is huge, with multiple wings that barely connect. You need to take more than one elevator to get to some rooms. If I had major mobility issues I would avoid this place. Overall a very decent room with a couple minor hassles and some concerted attempts at price gouging.Hotel is huge and be prepared to walk 10 minutes to your room going up elevators and then down elevators as you walk from building to building. Staff was helpful and friendly.
Breakfast was over priced $ 3.50 for coffee. $ 12.95 for an omelet. 
A fee for parking, a fee for wifiI stayed here before and after a cruise. Very close to the airport. 2 huge free shuttles run every 15 minutes. Check in was swift, room was large and clean. No plane noise to speak of. Bar and restaurant were fine. As a stopover hotel this was ideal. A slew of pilots and stewardesses stay here.I wanted a room with an airport view... Turns out my reservation was only good for a standard room in their outlying low level units. I had to pay a $10 upgrade/night to get on the 6th floor of the ""Tower"" facing the airport. This extra package, however, included ""free"" wifi and parking. So my $184/night rate bought me those extras. Overall the room was clean, had a microwave and coffee maker, flat screen TV and powerful shower head. The bed was comfy and the room had a balcony...which wasn't very useful but kind of nice to stand outside and watch some of the action on the airport side. The parking in the back required a pass to get through the gate so it felt more secured. I did not eat here other than a Starbucks coffee and muffin. It's a big hotel but once you find your way around you can get in and out fairly quickly. Overall nice stay.We frequently fly out of Seattle coming down from Canada (Vancouver area) by car. For a great room, regular shuttle, parking included in room rate for 7 or 10 days, the Doubletree is hard to beat. Short trip to and from Airport, friendly staff (sometimes a bit overwhelmed because it is always busy), food onsite but lots of good choices within walking distance (Sharp's Roaster, Mango Thai, for dinner, Dave's Diner for breakfast) and of course the nice chocolate cookie on check-in.After getting off the cruise ship early on Sunday it was very refreshing to know we could check in at 10 AM and the room was available at that time. We also had our upgrade request granted and received a balcony room. The room was extremely clean and wonderful, it exceeded my expectations. The only hiccup with whole stay was we had to wait 20 minutes for the shuttle driver to leave the the hotel and we really needed to have that time, because the delays through checking bags and getting through security was EXTREMELY time consuming...more than I have ever experienced at an airport. Thankfully we made our flight, but the delays at the hotel, increased our stress level.
I would recommend this hotel to all, but I would have people be mindful of using the shuttle and allow even more than normal time as Sea-Tac airport seems to take forever to get to your gate.When we checked in it took nearly 30 mins. We paid $30 for an ""upgrade"" to a room with an empty balcony that looks like a jail. Once we got into the room, we found a dead bug on the desk and a used band aid affixed to the smoke detector. We called the front desk and spoke to a female manager ""Tray"". She apologized and offered us at different room which we turned down. She later called and offered us a generous $30 off!! Wow what a generous offer, not!!! This should've been a full comp, but I would never ask for one. Nor would I come back for a free stay. F+I have stayed at this property on several occassions mostly when I'm on a mileage run from the east coast. It is great when one is arriving late and departing early and the shuttle is able to get you to the hotel in less than 5 minutes. I imagine the walk would be about 10 minutes but with luggage this would be quite challenging.
Appreciate the free wifi in the lobby as well as the Starbucks and of course the cookies upon check in. The property has recently undergone a major renovation yet it still maintains that Polynesian look that I like about the place so much. Despite the many attempts this place has made to help you find your room I still get lost every single time. Even the new smart phone application that allows you to scan a bar code and receive step by step instruction delivered on your phone got me lost.
The place is huge, but I enjoy staying here and the resort often comes up on Priceline/Hotwire for reasonable rates. The rooms are average size but more than acceptable. Have never parked a car at this property so can't comment on that. In the local area there are really no standout steak houses that I was able to find. Ended up renting a car and driving to Renton to visit The Keg, a Canadian favourite as you can see from the Canadian spelling of favourite.
All in all an average property that I enjoy staying at when at the SeaTac airport.My husband was just flying back from a deployment and we decided to stay in the city. We tried to book another hotel, but everything was already booked. If there was something else available we would have stayed there. This hotel was clean and had the basic accomodations. For the price we expected a little more. There was no microwave or refridge in the room. It seemed to be an older hotel. The bed was hard and the duvet was actually one sheet on the bottom and one on the top of a down comforter. If you're looking for a clean place to get some rest then this is fine. If you're looking for more then I'd recommend going somewhere else. This is just your typical airport hotel.Stayed for 1 night on Aug. 21st in a 1 king/2 queen room which is actually a suite w/o the microwave or mini fridge. You wouldn't know this from the room description on the hotel website which lists it as 1 king/2 queens but then describes it as a room with 3 queen beds. We took a chance and booked the room just to see what a room with 3 queen beds would look like. Our 2 young kids were thrilled to each have a queen sized bed to themselves in their own room. 
The layout of the hotel is very unusual and hard to describe - almost like an ""X"" with a neighboring building in the shape of a crescent. In our case, we had to take the elevator up a floor to use the walkway to cross over to the next building over then take the elevator down again to get back to the floor our room was on. The hallways are long and winding, almost maze-like in parts. It was verging on comical trying to figure out where our room was located. If you have any mobility issues I would recommend you request a room nearer the front desk/lobby. Many airline crew stay here and I overheard one of them say that this is the hotel where she always gets lost!
The free airport shuttle leaves every 20 min. on the hour. We booked our room as part of a park 'n fly package as their parking is valet only and seemed more secure than at other hotels in the area. While the room was spacious, it was on the ground floor and we were awakened around 6:30 a.m. by the sound of the laundry carts being pushed around the parking lot outside our windows. Fortunately, we had to get up shortly after that anyways. As a Hilton Honors member, my preference is for a room on a ""high floor"". Not sure if there were no other rooms of this type available on a higher floor but by the time we finally found our room we couldn't be bothered trying to find our way back to the front desk to request an alternative on a higher floor. Moreover, we were checked in by someone with a badge that simply read ""trainee"" and she seemed to be having a lot of difficulty processing our reservation. We didn't care to repeat that process lest things get messed up.
The buffet breakfast at about $18 is average. Service was very good in the restaurant. By the time you pay for 1 or 2 items a la carte, you might as well have the buffet.
We have stayed at this hotel several times now because of its proximity to Sea-Tac (5 min.), the free shuttle, the park 'n fly packages, and secure parking. Next time I will be sure to request a room closer to the lobby and will ask what floor it is on before leaving the front desk!
If you need a room for a night prior to flying out of Sea-Tac, and a secure place to park your vehicle while away, this hotel is wholly adequate.Our family of five stayed here for the night before our early morning flight. We chose the jet and park option which gave us 7 nights of parking.
Check-in took a couple of minutes and we went right up to our room.
Room was large enough and liked that there were two sinks (one inside and one outside) of the bathroom. My one complaint was despite having very comfortable beds, the sheets were VERY noisy. Everytime someone would turn in the night I could hear the sheets shifting and would wake me up.
We had dinner/drinks in the lounge and food and service was good.Arrived here after a long day of travel, having left the hotel we had reserved (because it was so awful) and having our luggage lost.... They couldn't have been, more hospitable! Brought me the extra sheet to wear as toga pjs! Supplied us with toiletries that had gone missing in the suitcase, really good food with room service - a pleasure after a harrowing day!I was very pleased with my 1-night stay at the Seattle Airport Doubletree. I arrived after midnight and was picked up by the shuttle within a few minutes. Check-in was easy. The hotel is pretty large, but I love to get extra exercise. Speaking of which, I found 2 fitness centers during my short stay. The light rail is very close by. I took a tour into downtown Seattle for $5.50 roundtrip. I also went for a nice 4-mile run. There are computers/printers to print your boarding pass. There is also a business room with 2 or 3 computers to use. Overall, I would stay here again if I were passing thru Seattle. The cookie was delicious, especially after a long flight.This is a really big hotel. I stayed here for two nights in July 2012. Overall, it was a good stay.
Pros-
-I am a Hilton Gold member, I was given two $10 food & beverage vouchers to be used at any restaurant in the hotel
-They upgraded me to a room with a better view
-The cookies (of course)
-Room was nice, large, and clean
-They have computers and printing stations to browse the web and print boarding passes
-They have multiple restaurants and a nice room service selection
-Staff was all very friendly and helpful
-Comfortable bed/nice big TV
Cons-
-There is another Doubletree Seattle Airport hotel (Doubletree Suites Seattle Airport) which makes it kind of confusing to find the right shuttle -- I never understand why hotels build two of the same hotel near an airport
-Room service was overpriced (no surprise here), but the food was fairly low quality
-I ordered room service on a Thursday night and then put it outside my door when I was finished eating, the tray and food was still sitting outside my door when I check out on Saturday morning
In conclusion, this is a pretty standard Doubletree airport hotel. No real big complaints. I'd stay here again. Would definitely recommend if you need to be near Sea-Tac.Pros: Convenient, 24hr airport shuttle, large property with on-site starbucks
Cons: Long walk to rooms in outer buildings, dated decor, soft/cheap mattress
It was ok for a short visit but would probably look elsewhere next time.Close to the SeaTac - Seattle airport we came by this hotel by bidding half it's asking price on Priceline. We couldn't get Hilton points but for $86 a night worth it. Easy access to the downtown train and the airport. Rooms clean and spacious.We have stayed here twice after winning it on Priceline. You can't beat the rate. Both times we stayed in one of the distant blocks. However there are advantages to this as you are away from the business of the cruise ship passengers. Pool is good for kids (outdoors). Parking is extra although in June we were given it complimentary as our preferred room type was not available.
Easy access to downtown and south centre mall.Stayed there only two nights. Very convenient to Link rail into Seattle. Link rail is easy to get to from airport.
Hotel provided shuttle which was convenient. Room was larger than expected. Everything was clean and
comfortable. If don't want to eat in hotel, which is quite large, there are convenient restaurants across street.
Would definitely stay there when going to Seattle again.We stayed here one night in July before jumping on the Amtrak to go to Vancouver for a cruise.
We had 2 rooms booked using points. My dad booked both rooms and is a diamond member of Hilton.
Our plane into SEATAC arrived late around 12:45am. I was very happy to find that there was a 24 hour free shuttle to the hotel. After coming from the central time zone, it had been a very long day and we were exhausted. After our luggage finally arrived, we waited about 10 minutes for the shuttle (it had apparently just left not long before).
We arrived at the hotel about 1:30am (the delay was at the luggage carousel, not the hotel shuttle). We were pleased to see there was a Jack in the Box across the street (24 hours) and a 24 hour Denny's. In the end though, we were too tired to eat.
Fortunately, my dad had checked us in already so I can't really comment on the front desk, although they were friendly in directing us to the correct elevator bank. We had been upgraded to a corner room in the tower. I think it was likely a Jr. Suite or something in that manner as the balcony was a HUGE wrap around balcony. The only confusing thing....NO chairs or furniture on the balcony. It almost made it worthless. In the morning, I made my coffee and took the desk chair outside, but we only had one. The shower was good, and there is a separate vanity area outside of the bathroom. There is also a safe in the closet and robes. The beds were comfortable, as expected.
We did not park, obviously, but I did notice it was very expensive to park. I would suspect it is at all of the hotels in the area, likely to cut down on people using their parking lots and then flying out as they are very close to the airport.
The tower rooms were a far walk, and to get the wonderful balcony, it's all the way down a very very long hall. Of course, it didn't seem so long the next morning after a good night's sleep.
We ate breakfast in the restaurant. We had vouchers, but I suspect we didn't get credit for them as I think I saw my dad's bill was around $70 for the 4 of us to eat. Maybe I missed something. I just kindly thanked him. The food was good. I think I had a standard-eggs, bacon, hashbrowns. My dad's wife had a vegetarian thing and LOVED It. It had zucchini or squash, not quite my kind of breakfast, but if you are into that, I rarely hear her rave about anything breakfast oriented so it must have been good.
One note: When we got to our room I realized there was no cookies. I made a comment the next day about not having our cookies. My dad gave a sheepish grin and said ""I thought you didn't like nuts"". Ok, I guess since he booked the room and paid for breakfast, he could have my cookie!
We waited for a shuttle in the morning which took us to the Light Rail. The light rail then took us to the Amtrak station. We dropped off our bags, checked in for the evening train, and then toured Seattle for the rest of the day. It was easy peasy and I was happy for that. I was concerned staying near the airport would make it a pain to get downtown, but it was very hassle free.a huge hotel with a nice feel, walking distance to airport, meaning if you can roll your bags you can walk right out of the airport and down the street a couple of blocks. Many SEA-TAC hotels are like this, but Doubletree is extra nice. Parking fees are a bummer, but you can avoid them by picking up or dropping a rent car after or before your stay. Staff is super. We missed a shuttle to the airport because we had left a cellphone in the room. The staff was right on it. They even proposed running to our room for us. The shuttle driver made sure that taking the next shuttle would not make us miss the plane. That kind of service makes you want to go back. Doubletree is a little more expensive, but so many airport hotels are squalid and a little scary. Not this one. It's worth it.I sincerely hope no one is actually paying full price for this property. I can't imagine having to pay over 200USD a night and once you're there -surprise!- you'll have to pay to park your car (who doesn't have a car in an airport hotel?) and for wireless internet! (18 dollars a day, that's just crazy).
In return you get a fairly clean, but quite outdated mega-hotel.
At a quarter of the price (say 50 dollars), you'll actually have to pay 50$ + 18$ (wireless) + 21$ (parking) makes (incl. taxes) close to 100$, which makes it still a not that interesting but acceptable cost. 
In conclusion: don't book here unless you pay 1/4th of the price.Very convenient hotel in a great location. Easy access to the Link Light rail to downtown. Clean and nice rooms with balcony. late night bar and food available, great for later arrivals at the close by SEATAC airport. Good easy shuttle service to and from airport .We often stay at this property. It's convinient to many things besides the airport. The property is clean & comfortable. The rooms are so comfortable you don't want to leave. They have at least two restaurants on sight plus a Starbucks behind the lobby area, Staff is friendly. They have a great pool area. Within walking distance to many resturants in the area & the airport as well as providing a shuttle to and from the airport which runs regularly.The hotel was fine. The parking fee was not. It cost us $21 to park overnight in the spacious, uncrowded hotel parking lot during the night of our reservation there. I'm not talking about leaving our car while we flew out, but simply an extra, sizable and unavoidable fee while we spent the night at the hotel. And this is significantly what has prompted me to write this review, as I consider it singular in all our hotel stays. We have paid (reduced) fees before when in a downtown location, using a nearby parking garage, but never in all the world in a hotel with a spacious lot in which we had the night's reservation.For a shade over 200 a night, there are better options available in the same proximity to Sea-Tac airport. They now charge for wi-fi as well. My room had ac that did not work, ants in the bathroom, and limited tv options for a hotel at this price. Check in was a 20 minute wait in line, and i found the food to be overpriced. I only stayed here because the holiday inn express was completely full. I would pass on this as an option and look elsewhere. The staff did issue a refund, and were pleasant, which was the one bright spotTravelling our way south on I-5 we got this one. I heard it's good for a SEA stop as well, which probably is the big chunk of their bookings.
Reception was as busy as you might think and honestly front desk has not much time if you need some extra attention. But it wasn't an issue anyway.
If you are passing by with your car, be sure you will be charged A LOT for parking. That was quite surprising for us, unfortunately. This is not inviting the drivers to stop by.
Apart from that, decent hotel.I booked this hotel because we were arriving in Seattle late at night and I wanted a place near the airport. I specified the need for a non-smoking room with two beds. When we arrived, they had only a smoking room with one bed. I asked to be given what I had requested and was told there were no such rooms available. I told the clerk why that was not acceptable and she insisted,, then took off for ten minutes. When she returned, she had miraculously found a room--on the far other end of one of the largest hotels I've been in. We had to lug four suitcases (more than I usually travel with, but we were going on a cruise) for a fifteen- or twenty-minute walk (I was using a cane so was slow). There were no porters to help with the luggage. We finally got to the room, and fortunately found comfortable beds. The next morning when I got into the shower, I found mildew on the grouting between the shower tiles. Ugh! Then, when we checked out, I discovered that the hotel does indeed have porters twenty-four hours a day. The thought that keeps going through my mind is,""I expect more from a Hilton hotel.""We arrived about 5:30 and were told by valet that there was a $25 per night parking fee. So we checked in, got our cookies,then took our rental back to the airport and rode the shuttle back. The room was very large and the beds were wonderful. We had some problem getting the room cool enough, but we knew we were leaving at 4:15 a.m., so weren't too concerned. No problems checking out and the shuttle to the airport left promptly at 4:20 as we had been told. The complimentary toiletries are by Crabtree and Evelyn and are lovely. Restaurant downstairs was nice and the complimentary bread and flavored butter were wonderful, but the menu selection wasn't very large. No microwave or fridge in room, but there was a Keurig style coffee/tea maker. But there were only two cups available - hard for three people to use.Got this as a last minute priceline, was a little concerned about some of the other reviews, but was pleasantly suprised. The hotel is sprawling, and there was some noise from doors opening and closing, but other then that, it was a good stay for an early morning flight. The rooms were modern(ish) and were very clean, which is my #1 priorityI stayed here in August of 2012 before an Alaskan cruise. We stayed here because of a recommendation from my sister who is an airline flight attendant. Overall I have no big complains, however, check in was horrible. I only SLIGHTLY fault the hotel because I was trying to check in early (around 1130am). Most people do not check in that early so I'm not going to make this a big deal, but there was only one staff member at the front desk when I tried to check in. There were only 2 people in front of me waiting but the bottom line is it took me 15 minutes to check in and that shouldn't happen. That was the only disappointment.
The room was great. The tvs are awesome and the bedrooms are a good size and the bathrooms are perfect.
The layout of the hotel is somewhat confusing (we had 12 people all throughout the hotel) but it's manageable and not too much of a problem.
Overall it's a great hotel. They have reliable airport transfers, nice rooms, and tasty cookies when you check in. I would stay here again.Hotel nickle & dimed us. No free in room Wifi and had to pay for parking. Room had ants and smelled. Room did not feel clean. Stayed in Bldg 5B. Getting to the room was convoluted. Hotel is comprised of several bldgs attached by skyways which requires one to take an elevator up and back down as the skyway is not at ground level. Elevator buttons were not properly working and ended up riding the elevator several times. Woke up during the night to the sound of planes. Would not stay there again - not worth the priceI was attending a conference at a nearby hotel, but it’s TA rating was significantly lower, so I decided to choose the Doubletree. I contacted the hotel and upgraded my room to a deluxe corner king room with balcony, and then requested the highest possible floor. I was asked what view I’d like (the Olympic range, thank you very much!) and my room was then PRE-ASSIGNED! This was the first time any hotel had ever done that for me, and I appreciated it so much. I was given the 12th floor in the tower – definitely a desirable room. It was in the refurbished section of the hotel, the balcony was huge and on sunny days, the view was gorgeous. I got some great photos of Mount Rainier and the Olympics. Despite being close to the airport and two major roads, my room was totally quiet. 
Housekeeping did a great job, the bed was comfortable and there were ample pillows, I could keep my room as warm or cool as I needed it. Any problems were minor – a note requesting additional coffee for the following morning was misread and NO coffee was left (a call to housekeeping fixed that within 15 minutes), and there’s no free wireless in the room (there are also no free refrigerators or microwaves). However, there is free wireless in the hotel lobby, and that was sufficient for what I was doing. And you can’t go wrong with warm Doubletree cookies!
I’d definitely stay here again if I had to stay close to the airport for some reason, but I’d always request the same room descriptors. I had friends who stayed here, and their experience was considerably less positive.We drove to the hotel from out of state and after working all day. Upon arriving at the hotel, our car blew a radiator hose. We had no idea what to do but watched as the hotel attendats went out of their way to solve this problem (and didnt have to!) We were so thankful for the help!
After that we were able to move our car and check in to the hotel. We were able to get a good nights sleep knowing our car was taken care of. 
The service all around provided by the attendants was quick and helpful, We felt safe and felt it was a friendly place to stay. Beds are comfortable and the rooms spacious, the dinner we had in the restaurant was very nice. We would most certainly stay here again. Thank you to the staff for making it a great experience for us!Airport hotel with 24 hr shuttle. This place nickel and dimes you. After telling me about charging for rollaway bed, this wasn't in the room and I had to make another request. Shuttle was the only reason I booked this hotel so I could return car rental the night before an early morning flight. However, even the shuttle was a hassle. Very crowded at 5am and bags got a little mixed up. Few minute delay, no major problem, but bit very professional.At first glance I was excited about staying here. I booked this hotel for 4 days and all seemed well until I was actually in the room for most of the day. I initially had a problem with a backed up sink and the shower or tub leaked like crazy after taking a shower. I spent so much time trying to correct this issue myself without any prevail. I was spending more time trying to figure out what was wrong with it that finally I just gave up! I asked the housekeeper if she could at least unclog the sink and she did. Thanks! Hei She was great and very efficient with her room cleaning skills! I also noticed on the 2nd day these big ant looking bugs dropping from the ceiling onto the bed which made it very hard to fall asleep at night. The last 2 nights were the worst. I had these things popping up from who knows where. I didn't have any food or sweet drinks in the room (I only drink water) so I don't know what the deal was there. I took pictures because I never seen anything like it before. Not what one would expect from a 3.5 star hotel. I wish I would have had the opportunity to at least try one of these famous cookies that everyone talks about but I wasn't even offered one at check in. I was in buliding 4 and the elevator wouldn't let me out on 2 occasions ( I thought I was going to have to use that red button) then 3 different times I had hit the button to take me to the 3rd floor only to be sent back to the first floor. A fellow guest told me to hold the button down until the doors opened in order to avoid being sent back to another floor. My room (4328) was the very last room to the right of the elevator on the 3rd floor and overlooked a small lake which actually looked more like a swamp and the balcony had so many spiders, webs, and bugs it was hard to stand out there. I spent as little time in that room as possible. I was dissatisfied with the quality of the hotel after alll of the issues I had. The bugs really grossed me out and I believe I was bitten by one as I slept as I had the biggest knot on my foot on the 2nd morning of my stay. These were not bed bugs just some kind of huge ant I mean huge for an ant. Also this hotel charges 21.00 for parking per day. At the end of my stay I had a 88 dollar bill JUST FOR PARKING! That doesn't seem fair considering that I was a paid guest. Guests should not be charged extra for parking or internet! I didn't pay for internet as I just tetthered my phone connection to my laptop for my normal monthly fee. I would have given this hotel a higher rating if it wern't for the bugs, clogged sink, elevator and parking oh and my cookie that I never received. It's a shame because I was all excited about staying here, bragging to my friend about my 3.5 star hotel. Who had a better experience at the cheaper hotel down the street with free parking. Gee Thanks Doubletree!nice airport hotel. felt very relaxing & had nice amenities. Even the little hallway sitting areas are appealing.
A single appeal to DoubleTree (an any other hotel reading these)...My only suggestion (this proves it was a pleasant stay if it's the only suggested improvement!) is that no hotel should stock green shampoo. Too many of us gray hairs running around that can't use it--tends to tint our hair green! I didn't wash my hair the night I stayed here due to not having a neutral colored shampoo. If they'd stock clear, white, or even really light yellow shampoo...I couldn't think of another thing to improve on.Hilton and Doubletree have provided an excellent example of their brand with this hotel. The check-in was the fastest I have ever experienced and the cookies don't hurt. The pre-printed name on my key envelope was a simple and noticed touch.
The room felt huge and very clean. The bathroom products and towels were exquisite. The big screen LCD TV was definitely in HD and had tons of channels. The balcony was a nice touch. Tried the pool out and found it perfect for a quick, refreshing dip.
The shuttle to SEA at 4:45AM was very convenient and super quick. Our shuttle was packed with flight crews and it was a good sign seeing them in a good, rested mood. Those guys know hotels.
We didn't try the restaurant, mainly because we fell in love with the Denny's across the street. Highly recommended Doubletree.Wonderful Hotel, I couldn't ask for more. the one down side is our room was in the last building which was about (or felt like with luggage) a mile from the lobby. but i still will recommend this hotel to my friend/family.Stayed here one night with the family. 
POOL: We were all very impressed with the outdoor pool as everything about it was beyond our expectations. Great loungers, towel service, high quality decking material, clean large pool for kids to play, some shade available all day around pool deck, even quieter than expected considering the airport is across the street.
BREAKFAST: A full breakfast was included in our room package for all 4 of us. This got us top notch service at the cafe including our server getting us Starbucks drinks from the Starbucks location elsewhere in the hotel. We felt for young kids (4 yrs old) the buffet had excellent options.
ROOM: We were in a 2 Queen Tower room. Kids loved the elevator rides as the elevators are on the exterior of the hotel with glass windows to look out. Room was standard but fresh, no visible wear or damage. Bed high quality. Even facing airport the room was silent. 
PARKING: Probably the only negative with this large hotel is the parking situation. The entire neighbourhood seems to be engaged in a parking rate war for airport passengers wanted to leave their car's for long durations. The hotel offers self parking or valet with only a few dollars difference. We had parking in our package but it turned out to be self parking, I figured that was no big deal, until I realized how far I had to park from the main lobby, there was a side door we used but it still wasn't close. There should be better access to the building from the large parking lots. Also the rates were weird - driving in the sign said parking - 12.95/day, but this wasn't for hotel guests, they have to pay $19.95 per day. If you ask me, guests should park for free, especially given the massive sized parking lot. 
Would we return again - absolutely. But you get what you pay for and this hotel is pricier than some other options in the area.Booked through Priceline, was very disappointed in the rooms. Felt old and moldy. If you stay here ask for a tower room not the ""upgraded"" lake view room. I felt like I was at a summer camp dorm room. Parking was $23 per night for self parking, unbelievably overpriced. Hallways were dirty and had trays from room service left out forever. The ""gym"" was a pathetic excuse for A property this size. Wouldn't stay here again if it was free, not my definition of a 3.5 star property And I stay in a ton of hotels. Seems as if it needs new management and a complete remodelWe spent 4 nights at this hotel. The presentation of the food was good. However; the taste left a lot to be desired! After the Rubin with very cold fries (all 12 of them) for lunch and tasteless Mac & Cheese with crab for dinner we walked across the street to eat at Denny's for breakfast and dinner. We ate at Taco Bell for lunch.The five of us were feeling UGH about an early flight, but the Doubletree at the airport was 1)very close, 2)easy to deal with, and 3) greeted us with fresh cookies! We love Hilton Hotels, and they have rewarded us for our loyalty. Job well done, Hilton!We stayed at the Doubletree July 20-31, 2012. We booked through Priceline and got the two nights for $128 total. I had read a review that said the ""Priceline Wing"" was very far away from the lobby, I don't know if we were in teh ""Priceline Wing"" but we were far from the lobby. However there was parking right next to our ""wing"" and we enjoyed the environment, there is a beautiful pond with ducks and a nice pool area so walking around was very relaxing. The only negative I have to say about the hotel was the $20 daily parking fee, I thought it was a little much, as the airport is right there I get it but I thought it was excessive. The hotel is enormous, beautifully decorated in every area, the bath soaps were very nice quality and the rooms spacious. I would definately stay here again.Airport hotels are rarely places one would go unless flying out early in the morning or flying in late at night. The Doubletree by Hilton at Seattle's airport defies that cliche'. More a resort than a hotel, it feels like something you'd actually choose to stay in on a vacation. The decor may be slightly dated in the hallways and public areas, but everything is in beautiful condition, including the gardens which abound outside the many windows and glass walls. The room I had was not large, but furnished with the best of linens and plumbing fixtures, and very comfortable beds. It also had a very large balcony with sliding doors - - how nice to be able to open windows and doors and let the cool Seattle night air in. There is a great bar, which also serves espresso and pastries in the morning, and a lovely restaurant which offers a full breakfast menu and outstanding breakfast buffet for a fairly reasonable cost. We saw the swimming pool, which is outdoors on a large and beautiful patio. The cost might be a little higher than some of the standard-fare hotels in the neighborhood, but for the extra $30 to $40, definitely worth it if you actually want to relax and sleep well before your big trip.While staying in Seattle for business, I choose to stay an extra night on my own cost somewhere near the airport. The hotel & accomdenations were visually good. My huge pet peeve was the extreme walk w/loads of luggage from one side of the estate to the other. We arrived by shuttle & had no ground transportation in order to just load ourselves over to our room destination...had we had a no vechicle, it would have been easier to drive around to where the building & our room was...but it wasn't the case. I had 3 large suitcases & my friend had 2 large carry-on style bags....the pure exhaustion from walking from the front desk all the way over to the furthiest point over in building 5 was horrible. No assistance was offered for us nor did we realize that the trek over was going to wear us out. The other issue was by the time we sorted our selves & wanted to get onto our laptops, there was no wifi available in our rooms & had to find a spot at the end of our building to sit down & turn on our laptops. By this time, we really were to tired to even try to bundle our arms with laptops, mouse pointers & cords to the available area to do so. And just said...screw it.This is a huge Doubletree with some good and bad qualities. 
First, the positives. It is close to the airport, rooms were fine, and generally the staff were professional. And, the maids were the happiest I have ever seen! Nothing but smiles and laughter from them. Also, for an airport hotel, there were a lot of reasonable eateries very close. 
Second, the negatives. Maybe this is my biggest pet peeve -- I hate having to go to the lobby to retrieve my e-mails. I hate how I look before a shower at 6 am.... and looking at all the other people all doing the same was no picnic either. At the time, the lobby was quite full too. Just ridiculous! Other negatives: (1) parking is very expensive; (2) the hotel was cold (common areas were probably around 58 to 60 degrees - I guess because they did not want to put on heat in the summer); (3) the ""gym"" was extremely small for a hotel of this size (they should probably either increase to a reasonably size or eliminate); and (4) check in was very slow (they seem to have too few front desk staff for a hotel this size -- I never passed the front desk without seeing a line).
Lastly, while neither positive nor negative, this hotel seems to cater to cruise lines and airlines staff.We stayed in this hotel before a very early flight. The location is great! We were able to hop on the Sounder light rail and make it downtown in under 30 minutes. The station was a long walk or a short courtesy shuttle ride from the lobby. The exterior of the hotel is dated, consisting of a main tower with 10+ floors and a campus of 2-3 story buildings. We were in the main tower and our room was updated and spacious. The shuttle promtly took us to the airport at 5am the next morning!Stayed one night as a Hilton Honors member. Room rate was $223. Even though I had almost 50,000 points, I had to pay $14.95 for internet. A full breakfast will cost you $20 plus tax. Parking will also cost you $20. The hotel is spacious and has some elegance, but it is an older hotel that shows its age. The room was spacious and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable. Standard tub bathroom with an additional sink outside of the bathroom. It is a huge hotel, so be ready to walk and walk to get to your room. Chaos seems to be the norm in the lobby. Nothing is near. It only has two washers for this huge hotel and one was broken. Lots of aircrew, so good luck trying to use it. If you are a loyal Doubletree customer, the much better value is the one at 16500 Southcenter Pkwy., Seattle, WA 98188-3388. It is within walking distance of everything from restaurants to shops. Upon my arrival tonight I received a code for free internet and vouchers for breakfast as a Hilton Honors member. The only major drawback is that it does not have a laundry room. It is an older hotel but it has been kept up nicely. Finally, I can not recommend the Doubletree at 18740 International Boulevard. Just go down the road a bit to one at Southcenter.Great location, clean spacious rooms. Super service. Upon arrival we were greeted by employee handing out chocolate chip cookies, lovely touch!!!
Only negative thing - paying for outdoor parking...it should be gratis for guests!!!If your looking for a place close to the airport for a short stay before or after your flight then you cannot go wrong with this hotel . Rooms are clean and spacious for a airport hotel , free shuttle to the terminal runs every 20mins and is only a 10min commute . The on property food and drink was typical airport hotel fair , though we thought $5 for a lemondae with the meal expensive , my wife could have had wine for $7 . Food was actually quite good.
Roms were clean , quiet and well appointed , met all our needs for the night before our flight place to stayLarge hotel with multiple spread out wings. Large generous rooms. Two sinks. Some rooms look over the water/pond. Don't forget the cookie. 
We walked to the hotel from baggage claim in less than ten minutes. The shuttle only comes every 20 minutes so sometimes it's better/faster to walk. 
We also walked to the Link in about seven minutes. Only two blocks north on the same side of the strreet as the hotel.Stayed here twice, arriving late in the evening and leaving early morning. Quick checkin with a warm chocolate chip cookie. A Wolfgang Puck coffee maker with good coffee went well with the cookie. Great bed. Just snuggled in and slept until our wakeup call.I have an annual project I work on in a city nearby. This year I made the mistake of NOT selecting this property, just to ""try something else.""
It was a big mistake on my part to choose (based on reviews by people luckier or less-picky than I) the Best Western Plus Plaza by the Green in Kent this year. For ever so slightly less than what I paid for this Doubletree property, I was treated to a dated property in a strip mall with a balcony so tiny it barely accommodated two people. Old caulk in the bathroom, dingy walls, barely okay bed (not that it mattered, since—as you will see—I couldn't sleep) and a carpet that had been cleaned so many times that it felt sticky even while appearing clean. Plus an obnoxiously loud air conditioner and walls so thin you could hear the people in the next room set their glasses on the bathroom counter.
In stark contrast comes this Doubletree. Big room, solid construction, quiet (despite airport and traffic), clean, excellent bed. Wraparound balcony. View of the mountain. The difference in price is negligible, even if you factor in parking and internet access.This resort is beautiful and full of great amenities! 
The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 was the service. . . . it wasn't awful by any means but most of it just didn't match the resort. In room dining dishes sat outside doors over night (and I saw staff pass by them), inconsistent and lacking answers from front desk/phone operator staff, and the shuttle drivers were not very welcoming or engaging.
Given the size of this resort and the amount of travelers moving through it, I'd suggest the airport shuttle run more often (perhaps every 15 min) and there be a shuttle to run guests within a few miles of the resort.
I would definitely stay here again - it was a beautiful setting and very close to SeaTac.We had a late flight to Seattle. Landed in Seattle around 12:30 am. We booked one night at the Doubletree by the airport. After getting the luggage, we waited for a while for the shuttle; we must have just missed one. When we got to the hotel, it was pretty nice. At check in, I requested for two beds. He noted that the room I reserved is through Priceline so I was going to get a king bed only. He looked around and said he will upgrade us to 2 double beds. He asked how many people were in my party and then he hand me some warm chocolate chip cookies. Yummy but I couldn't eat them because it had walnuts :o( We went to our room and I was pretty impress. The room had a balcony which looks to the parking lot but it has so many trees that the cars were not noticeable. They had 2 free bottles of water which was nice. The beds were comfortable. In the morning, we checked out. Wished we could have stay a few more nights there. Overall it was a really nice hotel.Con #1) Check-In Issues. The check-in line was out to the front door. Multiple employees were just standing around not helping. One was a manager and all he did was hand us a cookie. Nice and all, but I would rather him be checking people in so we didn't have to wait as long as we did. The check-in person also did not tell us where our room was located, times for breakfast, or check-out time.
Con #2) Counting issues. They knew we had 5 people in our room. We only had three towels in our room. HOW HARD IS IT to see that there is going to be 5 people in our room and then ACTUALLY account for that? Also, there was no extra toilet paper in the room…
Con #3) Minor maintenance issues. Peeling paint in the bathroom ceiling.
Con #4) Parking Fee. I hate this. Really?? I have to pay to park my car to stay at your hotel? NICKEL-DIME your customers and they remember.
Con #5) Room service trays were left in the hallways most of the day.
Con #6) No breakfast
Pro #1) Awesome beds. Even the roll-away bed was extremely comfortable.
Pro #2) Clean room
Pro #3) A/C was goodi stayed at this hotel for 1 night and received little to no service. staff super slow and super unhelpful, especially the lady looking after the bellman team who sits outside the hotel. complete disrespect for people and the notion of first come first serve. that is why i felt discriminated against. i waited in line, and was the first in line, only to get pushed over to receive ""help"" later, despite other staff in the hotel clearly telling her i was the first in line. what a horrible experience. Dont understand why anyone would do that to their guests so bluntly and disrespectfully. do not stay here if you demand any sort of service.To accomodate our flight scheduling, we stayed here one night. They have a convenient airport shuttle service. The room was spacious, very comfortable, clean, and quiet. We never heard any airport noise, or even any voices in the hallways. It is a huge complex, so it was a hike to the room (and requires breadcrumbs to find your way back to the lobby). Service staff were warm and friendly. We enjoyed great service and food at the lounge. Wireless only worked near the lobby, not in the room. It would be more convenient to have wireless available in the room, in addition to an ethernet connection (e.g., for iPad use).This has the most expensive add-ons I've ever come across. $20 to park a car over night, $19 for the Internet for a night, $1 for a .40 postcard stamp, meals were crazy high.
Our wing of the hotel was over a swamp, or maybe a water feature if you want it to sound more elegant.
It was across the street from a great BarBQ place, Sharp's Roast House.
Understand everything down by the airport is expensive, but it seemed excessive. I would have never spent my money on this place.
Room was very clean, bed was great.
Very close to the airport- maybe 4 minutes.This is a very large property and I assume that it has a wide variety of room types. We reserved a room using Priceline at noon on the day of our arrival. We paid far below one hundred dollars for the night and the hotel far exceeded our expectations.
Room: Two queen beds tower room
Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Even though we arrived on a full bus from the airport, check-in only took about 10 minutes.
The only problem we had was with the shuttle bus pick-up. We were waiting at the number 3 section outside the baggage claim with many other people. After waiting about 15-20 minutes the bus arrived and was over-run with guests. The bus left with about 10-15 guests unable to board, us among them.
We then walked down to the number 1 section outside baggage claim and waited another 10 minutes. This time we were the first and only people boarding the bus. Once we got to section number 3 the bus was packed with people. Needless to say, I highly recommend anyone using the shuttle to walk down to the number 1 section outside baggage claim.
Another option for taking a shuttle to the hotel is using the Wally Park which is directly across from the hotel. There seemed to be dozens of Wally Park shuttles so somebody on a hurry may want to hop on the first Wally Park shuttle and walk to the hotel.
We stayed at the Hilton two days later, and I would definitely prefer the Doubletree over the Hilton. There are a few places to eat walking distance outside the hotel (Dave's Diner and Denny's) or you can go to their coffee shop, which was quite busy when we walked by.Stayed just for 1 nite B4 early flight after trip where we stayed in 2 upscale hotels then this hotel. As Hilton HHonors Gold, we were upgraded to corner penthouse suite which was great. Wet bar, dining table couche, chairs & wrap around balcony. Seperate bedroom with comfy bed. Super large bathroom w/ large shower, huge soaking double & double vanity. HHonors amenity was $20 food & bev credit which could be used for room service. Great view of airport on even numbered rooms. Odd number could see mountains if in tower. Large meeting hotel with several 3 story garden view bldgs + the tower. Plus the cookies!!!!
Also good Thai restaurant (Mango Thai) across street in WallyParkMy husband and I stayed here for one night before flying back home. Check-in and check-out was fast and easy. The location was very close and convenient to the airport. The free shuttle service to the airport was excellent. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The food in the hotel restaurant was pricey. But there are many restaurants within walking distance and the conciege was able to recommend many good dining options in the area. We decided on a Thai restaurant right across the street which was very good. There was also a barbeque restaurant across the street that looked and smelled good. We ordered room service for breakfast and the service was prompt and the food was good--we had the Denver omelette. It would have been nice if the room had a fridge and microwave. This is a very large property and you may have a long walk to get to your room. That was not an issue for us. But if you want a smaller boutique style hotel, then this hotel is not for you. We would recommend this hotel and would stay here again if we are ever in the Seattle Airport area again.Stayed there for business, on my way back to the airport, for 1 night only. Big room, was certainly ok, with excellent bed. Environment very quiet, despite roads nearby. I stayed in a room facing a small lake and slept like a baby. The hotel is big enough to offer whatever room choice you want. Free airport shuttle. Restaurant/bar not too big, good food. All in all a good example of American hospitality. Interior is somewhat outdated, but all is in fine condition.We needed a spot convenient to the airport for an overnight before an early-morning flight home from an Alaska trip and this was a good choice. It's set up as a Conference Center so it's spread out, but there were pretty green areas and a large pool in the center so it didn't feel as much like an airport hotel. The shuttle from the airport is one floor down and across the street from the arrival level and it runs every 20 minutes during the day. 
Sorry I didn't take pictures; the batteries in both my cameras had died conveniently near the end of the trip. Our room was in the Tower and was spacious and had a view of the airport and the mountains behind. There was no refrigerator or microwave but it did include a coffeemaker. As Gold HHonors members, we were on a HHonors floor. Elite perks included 2 $10 credit certificates towards any food service, including Room Service, and 2 complimentary bottles of water. We also had free Wi-Fi. It worked well with my laptop but I could never log on with my iPod Touch.
TV seemed to be mostly news channels and the ""Channel Guide"" told you only what number corresponded to what network- no program information. Nearly every touch of the remote seemed to navigate towards screens touting their pay-per-view movies. Getting to the ordinary TV channels required hunting for an inconspicuous icon in the lower right corner of the screen.
The outdoor pool was glorious- generously-sized and just the right temperature. I shared it with a few kids who were obviously having a good time and we all coexisted peacefully. 
After dragging ourselves out of bed at 5:30 AM the next morning and throwing things in the suitcases, I had the brilliant idea of actually using a bellhop to get all our stuff downstairs- we had more than usual because of all the gear needed when we were in Alaska. Best tip money I ever spent. The bellhop arrived about 3 minutes after I called and got all the stuff from our room to the shuttle bus painlessly.
We didn't try the restaurants; note there's also a Subway franchise and a few other choices within easy walking distance. 
This hotel was a good choice; I'm glad we arrived in early evening so we had the chance to enjoy it.Older room in good repair. Bed was comfortable Long walk from the front desk to the room. Room was clean and well equipped. In this day you don't have free wireless in the room? Doubletree-----get with it.We spent our last night of travel here after a two week vacation and it was by far the most comfortable bed and linens. We took the shuttle to the airport then the light rail to downtown for sightseeing. Our room overlooked a lake and was very clean. This hotel is across from the airport. Give yourself extra shuttle time if traveling on weekends. Lots of cruise people and airport checkin was very long lines on a Saturday.The rooms are very nice, large, comfortable, tasteful. Denny's is across the street if you need your dose of Denny's. We stayed in the leftmost wing (I believe it is wing 4) and some of those rooms have a view over a pond which is very nice. the workout room was just at the end of the hall, and had all the machines you might want in it (I really appreciate this). the chocolate chip cookies were very lovely. The price was not the most lovely thing about it, but it certainly is convenient for the airport!Liked the fact that they had shuttle service to the airport. Only downside was the feather pillows. Otherwise a good experience.Overall, I really liked this hotel. The sound proofing in the rooms is outstanding! My husband is a very light sleeper and even though we were on the party wing at a fantasy and sci fi convention, we slept like babies. 
We had a family room with another family. A family room is basically two adjoining rooms without a bathroom in the second room. Their room was had two queens and the bathroom and we had a king (sans bathroom). There was a sink on either side, outside of the bathroom, and that really helped with privacy. I liked the furniture. Both rooms were more spacious than an average hotel room. I didn't book the room but the guys stated that the family room setup is much cheaper than the suites. It would have been nice to have a room overlooking the small lake, out back. (I don't know if that is possible with the family rooms). We overlooked the parking lot. All the roooms have balconeys (or porches), which is nice. 
The maid staff was excellent!
The only complaint is with a glitch in the electronic key system. We had six total people in the family room. We repeatedly had issues with one or more keys not working. It seemed that when two keys were fixed, another two (that were working previously) no longer functioned. Finally, a clever clerk figured it out. The hotel wide lock system is set up is for four persons per room. He or she (I didn't interact with this person) somehow did a manual override to allow six keys to our room. If you get a family room (or suite), please keep this in mind and advise the front desk. Apparently, they haven't trained everyone in registration about this glitch. The key situation was most annoying. Luckily for us, it didn't create any major problems.
The breakfast was overpriced hotel food. The menu food the adults ordered was better than most hotels. The breakfast buffet looked better than most breakfast bars at hotels. Kids can eat breakfast buffet for a reasonable price of $7.00 (that price stops at age 12). We used a friends food vouchers, with his Hilton honors package. However, if you don't have that, you'll be paying high prices.This place won't knock your socks off but if you're looking for a decent place at a reasonable value within a stone's throw of the airport, this is it.Really nice hotel right next to the airport - awesome for early flights. Stayed in the Tower portion of the hotel in April 2012. The new ADA rooms (hotel calls the suites - that seems a tad generous) in the Tower have been recently renovated and are just beautiful. That being said, the rooms are not huge. Found that getting the wheelchair at the right angle to get someone into/out of bed was a bit tricky. Not very much space in between beds. Also, the bathrooms are a little tight. However getting around the actual hotel (lobby, restaurants, etc) is fine. 
We stayed in the low-rise portion of the hotel in January 2012, also in an ADA room. The ADA rooms in the low-rise part of this hotel are much bigger, have roll In showers, and the grab bars in the bathroom much better placed. We found the bathroom in the ground floor rooms to be very cold though and did have a problem with the hot water (for which the hotel compensated us) .
The hotel offers an ADA airport shuttle with a wheelchair lift which is a great feature. There was lots of space on the bus for both luggage and people and the driver was able to get permission from the Airport to drop us off on the upper level to make it MUCH easier to get to the check-in area. Overall a great stay!This hotel is not bad in and of itself. Everything was clean and in good working order. The staff are friendly and courteous. The only complaint I have is that EVERYTHING at this hotel is overpriced. Room: $150 (been there before, not a huge deal, but there's nothing about the place to justify it). Internet: $4.95/hr or 14.95/day ( they do have free public wi-fi in lobby. It's slow and lobby is loud, so forget Skype-ing the wife and kids). Really? It's 2012 and I've stayed at Motel 6s with better, FREE wi-fi. Parking: $20/day to self-park!! Come on! Restaurant: A run-of-the-mill Rueben and 2 domestic draft beers? A mere $32. This was the second time my office has booked me here, and it will be the last. I found WAY cheaper, better options right across the street.Most of the people are there for a short staying. Hotel is just near the airport, and has a free shuttle from and to airport. In the peak hours it is a large bus, so don't worry, you'll get there. The room was large, nice view (ballcony), large bathroom, all clean and equiped in all basic ""necessities"". Bed was super soft!!!
Our price was without the breakfast, and for fast goers, there was $20/ per person buffey with eggs, sausages and so ... I thought the price for the breakfast was on the high side, and next time we'll try the fast-food ""breakfastry"" accross the street. We recommend this hotel very much.Great staff and comfortable rooms. Convenient to the airport and also the light link rail to downtown, Space needle, museum, etc.We stayed one night after a long flight before flying up to Fairbanks Alaska next day. We needed somewhere quiet and comfortable and that is what we got. We had a great night sleep.
We had a good buffet breakfast early at 6am for $18.(useful because Alaska Airlines will sell you food on the plane but no veggie options) Just one negative comment. A larger shuttle bus, or more regular ones, would be good. It was very crowded both to and from the airport.I booked this hotel through the Princess cruise line. It was perfect for touring Seattle on the Friday before we cruised. There was a shuttle that took us back to the airport for us to use the tram/train to get around town. They also took our luggage for us from our room to the ship. Everyone was friendly. My 16year old daughter left her wallet in the room with money she had saved for this vacation. We called back and the house keeper had turned in her wallet. That goes a long way with me since they could have just kept her wallet. Doubletree offered to mail it back for us. Just worth the money to stay here .The hotel staff was friendly and quickly fixed our toilet that seemed to keep running every 2 minutes. They have really good cookies they give you at check-in, but for the price, this is an older looking hotel that looks well used. Close to the airport which was convenient, however the shuttle that is suppose to run every 20 minutes filled up on our way to the airport, so we were left waiting. That ended up being ok, but when we returned from our trip and needed a shuttle back to the hotel, we were left waiting for over an hour! Not happy! We paid to park our vehicle for the week at The Doubletree while we were on vacation. An employee tried to take care of our parking cost, because we were left waiting so long, but a manager told him we already paid when we booked our hotel room and they can't give refunds. So be careful of the stay and fly. It's expensive for the quality of hotel and the inconvenience they caused.My wife and I flew in to Seattle on June 15, 2012 for a West Coast road trip to celebrate our 23rd wedding anniversary. I had the first two nights of our trip booked to stay at this hotel due to our scheduled itinerary. We arrived at the hotel at 11:30 PM and it was very crowded during check in. It is right by the airport so after each flight arrival I imagine it fills up like that. The lady that waited on me was very kind but kept searching around on the computer with the mouse like she was looking for something. I offered her my receipt and confirmation number I had printed but she said she didn't need it. She kept saying that she was just trying to find me a room. I thought to myself, ""Find me a room?! I have the receipt in my hand right now where I have paid for 2 nights over a month ago. I better have a room."" After a little more searching she said she was going to put us in the tower on the 13th floor. I didn't know what that meant. She gave us some fresh baked cookies, our keys, and an overnight parking pass and sent us on our way. Were we in for a surprise. When we got to the room, it was a double-doored honeymoon suite. This was the biggest, fanciest room I have ever seen in my life, let alone stayed in. It had a full kitchen, dining room, living room, two bathrooms, huge bedroom with very comfortable king size bed, several closets, and a huge balcony. There were three full size double sliding glass doors that went out to the balcony, one in the dining room, one from the living room, and one from the bedroom. All these exits went out to the same balcony. It was huge. The bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever felt in any hotel. I have no idea how I got this room other than I know it is not the one I booked online. I don't know if that was all they had so they just let me have it or if someone made a mistake or what. They didn't charge me a dime extra for it. It sure started our vacation out on a good note. I wish we could have stayed there the whole trip but we were doing a road trip so stayed somewhere different every night after those two nights. I'm not sure if this review would qualify for a regular room or not. I can't say how good or bad they are. I just know this room was awesome. Not sure if I got the free parking pass because I was in this suite or if you normally have to pay for parking with a regular room. It was right across from the Seattle airport but that was no problem. You couldn't even hear anything from inside, and it made for some cool photo opps from the balcony of the jets taking off.Our flight was delayed by 9 hours so instead of waiting at around at the airport with 3 children and 2 elderly adults, my husband and I decided to find a nearby hotel to make everyone comfortable during our wait. I found the DoubleTree and called them right away from the phones in the airport and the person that answered was very helpful and told me they could offer a half day rate since we would not be staying overnight. Bingo! They have a FREE shuttle that picked us all up and the hotel was less then a mile away.Walked in and we were warmly greeted by the front desk staff and then came the yummy chocolate chip cookies! The lady that checked us in was wonderful!! Wish I rememberd her name...Ruby (from Etheopia)? Not sure but she was so nice and helpful! We then went up to our room and it was a very nice large and spacious room! The kids also loved the pool and hot tub area. It's a beautiful oasis out there! The whole experience was wonderful from start to finish and my husband and I said we would come back to Seattle just to stay at this hotel again.Very disappointed at the rooms and the additional charges for parking. Public areas were kept nice however the staff was ambivilent, and the room looked like it was last decorated in the 1980's except where they threw in an LCD TV.
I had a discussion about the parking with the front desk and he told me essentially, too bad. I am a corporate traveller and on a company budget. As well Hilton is a prefferred Hotel for our company.
Very disappointed in the ""well used up"" facility.A colleague selected this hotel to get Hilton points while we paid a visit to a client in downtown Seattle. It was extremely convenient to the airport and highways into the city. When I pulled up, wasn't sure what to expect, but my tower room was lovely -- large and well appointed. It looked brand new. Had two dinners in their restaurant. Nice menu and decent food, although service could use a little more polish. One night they seemed very short handed on wait staff. We had a good rate, especially compared to what a comparable hotel downtown would have been. I would definitely stay again.We had the unfortunate experience of having to be put up in a hotel when we weren't able to fly out. We were given a room at the Doubletree and things couldn't have worked out better. 
The lobby is clean and full of amenities from multiple eating and seating areas to even a virtual golf range which I took a couple hacks in. The ""Olympic"" weight room wasnt exactly up to Olympic standards but it still had what I needed to get in a good workout. Also the outdoor pool was nice with plenty of seating around the edge. 
We were upgraded to a Penthouse level room with a great view of Mt Rainier. I found it interesting that the numbers started with 13, my superstitious side was working overtime. The beds were super comfortable and the shower with its massage head was amazing. 
Ramesh, Jeff and all the concierge, front desk and shuttle staff were engaging and friendly, thank you everyone. 
Lastly, Rissa is an amazing manager. Her customer service skills are unparalleled, thank you RissaThe location is good if you just want a hotel for layover at SeaTac, but if you also want to see downtown Seattle, it's just too far away and the transportation was not as good as I expected. The hotel room was just okay, typically Doubletree with no surprise. There's a pub in the hotel, and you may see some hippy and, to some extent, doubtful people in the hotel, which I don't find comfortable. I guess I'll choose the Hilton next time if I need to stay at SeaTac again, or some downtown Seattle hotel instead.The stay started out with mobs frantically crowding into the airport shuttle bus as if it were the last trip from earth on the day of the apocalypse. Turned out that the hotel is used by cruise lines to house people departing for a cruise the next day and my sense is people not comfortable with traveling. After the pushing and shoving was the mad rush to the reception desk to check in. After a long flight, this was a bit much and contrasts sharply with my more recent stay at the Hilton just up the road-- admittedly not during cruise season. A strength of the hotel was certainly the customer service of the shuttle van drive and the reception staff who I firmly believe should be payed battle pay. The hotel itself was okay, standard for a Doubletree. The room was average sized, nicely appointed but not anything special. Breakfast the next morning was good with good service. The shuttle back to the airport the next morning to catch a flight for the next leg of my flights to Alaska was much calmer.We were very pleased with the Doubletree Hotel at SEATAC for many reasons. They are customer focused and very willing to please. The room and bathroom were extremely clean. The beds were excellent and everything was up-to-date. We had stayed in several ""lodges"" during our two week trip to the Seattle area and were quite dissatisfied with most of the accommodations. The Doubletree capped off our visit by offering everything a hotel should at 1/3 the cost of what we have been paying for while seeing the many ""wonders of nature"". We would gladly stay at this hotel again if in the Seattle area and have only good memories of this location.An absolute disgrace. My son had to delay his flight by 3 days due to illness, so we asked - with over 24 hours notice - to rearrange (not even cancel) his 2 day booking for 3 days later. They stated that as the rooms were pre-booked they cannot be cancelled and we would be charged for the unused room. This is not the sort of customer service I expect, so will NEVER use a Hilton again. 
The airline, hire car company etc were all accommodating, but not Hilton, even though not fully booked. A very short sighted policy to make a few easy bucks from a customers misfortune.
Unfortunately I originally gave this review to the Princeton Double Tree by mistake. So disregard that review, although if it is a Hilton group Policy and not a Hotel one then the same would apply.An absolutely fabulous facility VERY close to SeaTac...24 hour complimentary shuttle so you have a reliable ride even if you arrive or depart in the wee hours!
Good food and beverages on site or nearby...nice pool area...very reasonably priced for what you get...and the warm cookie on arrival is a nice touch!I was there for an overnight, the front desk was friendly - it can be a walk if you are staying in the tower. This is just an average hotel.There is a free shuttle to and from Sea-Tac airport. The hotel's beautiful landscaping relaxes the weary traveler. The reception desk staff are friendly,knowledgeable and caring. The concierge staff is very helpful and will help the traveler find whatever they need. Hotel rooms are large and impeccably furnished.The small room refrigerator is stocked with soft drinks and bottled water(fee) It would be nice to have a continental breakfast available, but there are restaurants across the street. The concierge can arrange a shuttle to the cruise piers for $12 per person. I would definitely stay at this Doubletree by Hilton again.Of course, the big warm chocolate cookies are a definite bonus!Just spent 2 nights at the Doubletree by Hilton Seattle Airport. Great hotel, excellent facilities and great staff, can't do enough to help. Very comfortable, high standard and safe. A great start to a holiday. So close to the airport and free shuttles all the time to and from the hotel made everything so easy.Booked this hotel so that I would be close to the airport for a 6:30 AM flight. For some reason, they designed this place to resemble a tropical resort, as it is a LONG walk to to your room. The property is basically 7 buildings separated by streets and ponds. They are connected by skyways on the second floor, so there is a lot of going up and down stairs / elevators if your room is on the ""first"" floor. It seriously took more than twenty minutes of brisk walking to get to my room in the seventh wing.
I suppose this place would be nice for congresses, meetings and the like, and I could not even hear the jets taking off. But leave yourself LOTS of time to leave at checkout.
The is a large bus as a shuttle to the terminals that runs every 20 minutes.I booked a two rooms for a single night. The shuttle service to the airport runs every 20 minutes or so, and was a real help as we had to make several trips for various reasons including lost baggage.
The rooms was spacious and clean, the warm cookies a nice bonus, and the floor we were lodged in was quiet and well maintained.
I was surprised to find that the in room internet use was an additional charge, but oh well.
The only issue that did arise was when a couple of very late night calls were made to my room regarding payment for a stayover. My companion in the other room got a simular call AND a personal visit by security. Seems as though some one with the same last name owed the hotel funds for a room as well, and not payed.Allow we had prepayed through the internet, At first they were very insistant that I make arrangements to pay these charges until they realized that we had just checked in a few hours before. Needless to say it was a confusing and somewhat alarming time. I assume they figured it out eventually. But the incident did dampen what could, and should have been a great experience. would I go back again? Yeah probably.Stayed at the Doubletree one night before an early flight. The hotel property is large with a tower plus several smaller buildings. The public spaces are nicely decorated & very comfortable. 
I stayed in the tower --- a room with two queen beds & a balcony. Room was very clean, bed was comfortable and I loved that it was quiet!
Parking is expensive $16/night for self parking (valet $20) plus internet was $14.95.
Two well equipped fitness centers plus a large outdoor pool.
Hotel has great restaurants & a bar. Plus several restaurants/fast food in walking distance (Subway/Jack in the Box/Taco Bell/Thai Food)My wife and I spent only one night at the Doubletree, but wished we could have stayed longer. This is a first class hotel. Beginning with the courteous hospitality professionals at the registration desk. After handing us our room keys we were givin warm cookies. Our room was a standard king which was of good size and nicely furnished. sicne it was raining we didn't use the pool but it did look inviting and we were told the water was heated. Seaport, the on site restaurant offered an excellent menu featuring many seafood dishes at reasonable prices. The Doubletree is right outside Sea-Tac Airport so it is convienent for travelers who will be flying. If our travel plans take us to Seattle this is the place we will be staying.I think this is the fourth SeaTac hotel I have stayed at during business trips, and I liked it. The hotel room was clean and quiet. Great bed, nice bathroom amenities, pleasant service staff. The property is much bigger than some of the other hotels nearby, and I noticed the lobby bar looked pretty busy when I walked by.We stayed at the Doubletree on the backend of our Aslaskan cruise. We just needed one night and wanted something close to the airport. This is a very nice hotel with an excellent shuttle service. The room was large and clean. The bathroom was very large, but had a bathtub instead of just a shower which we didn't care for. Had a little trouble with the faucet in the tub, but not enough to call them. We used the shuttle a total of four times in our short stay. We were able to use the train service from the airport to downtown and Pike's Market. All in all, it was very convenient. The only negative was the restaurant in the hotel. We thought it was very expensive for what you got for food and cocktails. We had also eaten twice at the restaurant in the Maxwell Hotel and it was much better and more moderately priced. However, other than the restaurant the hotel was very good.This is a great place to stay! Some of the things I really liked were the comfy bed, great shower and bath products, the long vanity in the bathroom and good lighting, plug-ins on the lamps on both night stands, flat screen TV and the double cup coffee maker. We stayed overnight to catch a flight in the morning and had a very comfortable stay. Would definitely stay again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.I stayed in the ""tower"" building which has been recently renovated. Very nice decor, quiet and airy. On-site Starbucks coffee, Friendly attentive staff. Good parking.
Only downside was cost of food. When I travel I tend to use room service often so I can work in my room. Breakfast for two (in the restaurant) was $45. Cold continental breakfast was $13 (not counting coffee and juice). Room service dinner for one was over $50. I am used to paying a premium for room service but it just seemed high in general (esp for a business traveler).
Being so close to airport was not a problem because rooms were well insulated.
At checkout I had a cup of coffee for the road with me and young woman at check-out insisted on sending me off with one of the warm chocolate chip cookies...nice touch on the way out the door to end on a positive note.After 8 hours of travel and the clock says 1am, my husband and I call the shuttle from the airport and they say he will be right there as it is just across the street. 25 minutes later and another phone call, the shuttle shows up. we unload everything and come to the front desk exhausted. They tell us they overbooked and have to send us across the street. They say they will comp our room...because they take us to The CLARION. They had an attitude like this is how life goes sometime. You're right you should comp my room because I did not reserve a room at The Clarion, I reserved a room at The Doubletree. Great service would have given a night free there considering we have a room booked there before flying home as well. Won't happen and I will be contacting headquarters. If they knew their entire hotel was booked why didn't the tell us that before hauling us there??convenient, quiet, great shuttle service, highly recommendedVery efficient stay. Got in late, shuttle right on time, large shuttle, driver helped with bags. Plenty of staff to expedite check in at 1 AM. Very comfortable bed. Good, if a little expensive breakfast. What more do you want in airport hotel?This is a really wonderful hotel right opposite Seatac Airport. The rooms are very large with very comfortable beds and the room itself is always warm and homely. I have stayed at this hotel many times and every single stay without exception has been a great experience.
The staff and facilities of this hotel are fantastic, there is a beautiful heated pool and a great bar as well as an enormous parking lot. Finding a car space is never ever a problem. I will always stay at this hotel when I am in Seattle.This was a quick visit to Seattle and we needed an airport hotel. The Doubletree turned out to be a good choice. Friendly and helpful staff in a well-maintained and expansive facility. The room was all one could ask for - roomy, comfortable, quiet and spotless.Stayed here for one night on business. The hotel shuttle is fast and efficient. Staff all seemed friendly. Warm cookie at check in as others have stated. The concierge was helpful and gave me directions on how to find the light rail station at the airport as well as a map of the city and how to get around and see the various attractions in Seattle. 
The entire hotel feels like a lodge in the mountains not an airport hotel, which was a pleasant change. Cozy places to sit in the lobby, in front of fires, in front of windows etc. There is also a small gift shop in the lobby with various souvenirs and OTC medications etc. The pool and hot tub are in a courtyard in the middle of the pool. Although I never used them they looked warm as there was steam coming off the pool. 
It was a fairly long walk to my room, and the hotel was a bit confusing but after the first walk it seemed much simpler. A few minutes after I got to my room a housekeeper came to the door. Her English skills weren't that great so I can only guess she didn't realize I had checked in yet, but she was friendly. Although I did not use the restaurant on site they were helpful and gave me some plastic utensils to eat my breakfast the next morning before my early departure. I also discovered an annoying quirk. The TV remote only worked when I was sitting on the edge of the bed or standing right in front of the TV. It would not work when I was back in bed like a normal person. I figured I could live with it until I went to iron and the iron wouldn't turn on. So I called down to the reception desk. A cheerful woman answered and was very friendly. She sent replacements up and they arrived very quickly. The man that brought them didn't have the greatest English skills but it was manageable and he was friendly also. The replacements worked without issue. 
The bed was very comfortable and the entire room was spacious and clean. They also had the lamps with electrical outlets at the bottom which is useful for charging electronics (rather than having to unplug something or move a dresser to get to the outlet etc) 
One thing about the room... it isn't in the pictures I posted but there was three pieces of furniture all lined up on the same wall (same wall as the TV). Not a big detractor, but it's just a sign the room isn't the best layout. I always thought when you have pieces of furniture all lined up on a wall like that it looks like a furniture store. My room had a small balcony, but the balcony was covered with pigeon poop... if they got rid of the pigeon problem they could put a pair of chairs out on the balcony and make it really feel like a lodge. 
All in all a good night stay, although I don't know that I would stay there if I had a car with me due to the lack of free parking, but the light rail and the airport shuttle served me just fine for my one night stay.I overnighted in the Doubletree before I started my road trip through Highway 101 from Seattle. The hotel had a shuttle service that picked me up which was pretty decent. The staff at the reception was also very friendly and very helpful, recognizing my Hilton Honors membership. Overall the hotel and the rooms seem a little old but the beds were comfortable and the night I spent was uneventful. Parking at the hotel is at a charge so is the internet (unless you are a Gold/Platinum Honors member). Overall for the price the value of the hotel is okay. I feel that this hotel is generally for conferences, seminars and the like and if you have a conference close by this would be a great place to stay. For personal vacation next time, I would probably choose a hotel a little farther from the airport.This hotel seems like a former Embassy Suites, all the rooms are living room in the front and bedroom in the back, and OK but not very updated. Lots of meetings going on. Included breakfast for us, but there was a meeting with a welcome table set up smack dab in front of the only elevators, making for a congested situation. This hotel just isn't one of the best Doubletree properties, a bit shop worn.Besides warm chocolate cookies as promised, Doubletree Seattle Airport offers a great room to rest and relax. The airport shuttle is convenient. Will come back again.Hotwire is always iffy, not knowing which hotel you will get. This was rated 3 1/2 stars, and I ended up happy to stay here. Large room, very quiet, nice staff. Parking is high, but if you take a look, across the street and next to Thrifty Rental Cars, there is airport parking much more reasonably priced.I was traveling to Seattle on business and attending a workshop at the Doubletree. For some reason I expected complimentary Wifi and at least a free continental breakfast. The hot breakfast is a whopping $20.00 per person for eggs, hash browns, sausage and then the various continental foods. The pool and hot tub are outdoors so I didn't have a chance to use them however they looked nice.
I had tried the front desk once during my trip and it rang and rang for 30+ rings. I never did get to talk to anyone. They do only have one resturant for lunch/dinner and the menu is the same for both. I found it quite boring by the 3rd day. Save your money and head over to the Mango Thai restaurant across the street.
The staff were not overly friendly, except for a housekeeping attendant (older asian woman) who smiled and greeted me every time she saw me. I didn't get that level of service from anyone else, in fact when I was checking in, I asked if they knew if the gift shop had any motion sickness medicine like Gravol (this medicine is called Dramamine in the States, but I am Canadian and didn't know that) and they were not helpful at all. I had to go looking for myself.
Shuttle was prompt to and from the airport.We drove in from Vancouver, BC to catch an early morning flight to New York, NY. This hotel was very close to the airport. Shuttle took 10 minutes to get us there and was on time. The hotel itself seemed huge!! Our room was clean and very spacious for the three of us. I would definitely stay here again!!
The only downfall: no internet in the room and you had to pay an extra $15 if you wanted it. Otherwise, you could sit in the lobby for free internet. So, why not offer it????? By the way, the hot cookies at check in were a very nice touch and they were delicious.Typical Airport Hotel, good clean prompt staff. Happy with my stay even though quick overnighterI stayed in room 5336 and while it was a spacious room, it had definitely seen its better days. The veneer at the bottom of the bathroom door was half missing, making me feel like I was in a flea bag motel. When I went to take a shower in the morning, I had to pull the handle out to get the shower going. When I pulled, most of the shower fixture came right out of the wall - wasn't sure I was going to get my shower. As a diamond member, I get free internet and was given the code by the front desk clerk when I checked in. Got to my room and it didn't work. Called the front desk and after 22 rings, it was finally answered. Turns out the front desk clerk gave me an incomplete internet code. For a property caring the Hilton name, I was not impressed - but that how it is in most cases anymore with Hilton properties. This Doubletree was huge and there is plenty nearby as far as places to eat. The $22 to park was also something that irritated me. All in all, the hotel is okay but reflects how many of the high end Hilton properties are which is going downhill - especially compared to Marriotts and Hyatts.Room was very good. Comfortable bed and chair. Had a large screen TV. Bathroom had a large shower but no tub. Though the hotel is very near the airport I did not have any noise issues. I was there while a convention was being held and they only had one of the restaurants open at lunch time. This made for a long wait to eat. There are a couple fast food restaurants and a couple diners within walking distance. I took advantage of those instead of waiting. Staff was very friendly and I would have given an excellent rating on Service except for the restaurant issue.We spent the night here after flying into Seatac Airport. 
For a Doubletree or a Hilton, they charge you for everything. $20 for daily parking and $15 for daily internet usage, except they have free wifi in the main lobby. A great location if you want a quality hotel near Seatac. There are a number of convenience stores, and fast food and sit down restaurants nearby.
Our 2 queen beds were comfortable, the room was spacious and quiet, as we were at the end of the first wing.Saying there was great service is a big deal for me when it comes to hotels....I work in customer service at a hotel so I'm a critic. Stay here you won't be sorry...everything is so nice and clean and very friendlyLarge hotel complex - almost campus style - across the street from SeaTac airport. Front desk staff was exceptional, friendly and smiling when you checked in.....Had dinner at the hotel and Halibut was outstanding....Beer was expensive, 10 bucks for a large. Bed was comfortable and room was large on the HHonors floor. Excellent place to stay for an early flight our of SeaTac airport. Took 30 mins from leaving hotel, returning rental car, going thru security and walking to my gate - not bad for a 0600 flight.
Long ways from downtown Seattle so if your touring, then you may want to pick somewhere closer....strictly and airport hotel.My daughter and I had a very early flight out of Sea-Tac so I wanted to stay near the airport the night before. We were traveling alone, so location and safety were a concern. I also wanted a good location to leave my vehicle during our trip. The hotel is older, but kept up very nicely- front desk staff was very friendly and efficient.
Our room was facing the airport, but even with being so close to the airport, the noise was not unbearable at all.
Room was clean, good sized and perfect for our quick over-night stay and early morning departure.
I felt safe and comfortable in the hotel as well, traveling alone with my young daughter.
The valet parking option and shuttle to the airport were good as well- my only complaints would be having to wait for a bit for pick-up and the fact that getting through on the number provided to have my car ready was a bit frustrating. Other than that, everything went well and I would use this hotel and parking again if needed,We wound up staying here on the concluding night of a vacation (early flight the next morning). The hotel itself is a pretty big compound, with a gift shop, restaurant, bar, etc; and some food options nearby (albeit not great ones). Parking seemed expensive for the area. The rooms are pretty big and the beds aren't bad. The two complaints I really had with the place were the general age of the facilities, old decor, and the balconies. We stepped out on the balcony a couple times and were frankly a little terrified to move (3rd floor), the thing sways, and felt like it was buckling under our weight (combined around 380 lbs). As such this may have once been a good, if not great hotel, but it is definitely showing its age.I was just looking for a place closer to the airport with shuttle service to crash before catching a 6am flight home...wish I had a few more hours to explore it. This place is huge! I was surprised how quiet it was given that my room looked right at the airport. My room was very large and comfortable. The carpet in the hallway smelled brand new. The whole place was very clean and spacious. The shuttle ran every 20mins like clockwork.Really nice hotel with a great staff. Rooms are clean and comfortable. 
Avoid having drinks in the bar. The prices are way over priced
Exp: domestic glass of beer-$6. For some, this may not be a big deal but I think it's crazy.Was pleasantly surprised with our room in the side buildings of the Seattle Airport, Double Tree. Was a bit tentative about the hotel once I learned it had a 3.5 star rating, but I've enjoyed every bit of our stay here so far. It has a lovely, reminiscent feel of the late 1960's, from the parking lot, to the pool area and all the way into the rooms. The rooms are renovated and kept beautifully clean. Not a bad find. We would stay here again and would recommend to others. Great deal!Have stayed here multiple times when in the area on Business. Big property. Close to the airport and easy access to the express way. Great Service from front desk, rooms were clean. Roomservice was above expectations. Would definatley recommend. If you have a car to park, there is an extra $18 fee per day for self parking.The hotel is huge with lots of quiet places to relax. The room was also very large, with very comfortable beds and pillows. I had a balcony off the room, which seems standard with many rooms. There were many different shuttles to use to get you around the area free of charge. I wish they would have offered a continental breakfast, or at least a fridge in the room to keep a few things since I was there so long.I stayed here for 1 night before catching an early flight in the morning. I took a bus from downtown Seattle to get to this hotel, it was not exactly easy to find. The hotel had a pleasant reception, everyone got a delicious warm chocolate chip cookie as a welcome present. The room was spacious. It was a suite with a living room area, and a bedroom. I also used the swimming pool. The water could be a few degrees warmer. But I was told that they could not warm it up further due to the regulation in Seattle. (Hmm?) The shuttle to the airport was convenient. It was a pleasant stay.Rooms are average for furnishings, and the bathroom is nothing special. The corner balcony suites in the tower are very spacious and the higher floors have lovely views of the mountains. Was there for a convention, and the service was very good despite the hordes of people. Lost points for no free wifi and the EXPENSIVE parking. The restaurant is quite good for a hotel.Hotel is nice but the valet parking people were rude and my car got keyed. Their insurance refused to pay. I would not let the valet people park. I think they keyed it because we were in a hurry to catch a flight and I didmnotmtip them. I planned on tipping when I got back. Park at your own risk.I have stayed here many times over the last 2 years and it is always a very pleasant stay. From the warm cookies to the airport shuttle everything is delivered with great service and a smile. The rooms are average. Bedroom areas are nicely done and renovated, but the bathrooms are just average. This is a large spreadout hotel, so if you don't want to walk, make sure you tell them at checkin and try to get a room that is closer. I have not used the restaurant, but I have visited for several conferences and that food is always better than expected. The valet and shuttle service for stay and fly in great. It can be pricey, but I have snagged good deals a couple times (7 days parking and 1 night for $119!).OK-no wireless in the rooms? So you want to charge me 15 bucks for wireless in the room? Please, at this point maybe you should invest in getting free wireless in the rooms-all others in the area have it. Parking-20 bucks-I understand that this is the airport area but it seems a bit excessive. Good rooms-a few restaurants across the street. All in all-a decent hotel. May be a 4 star if they could get free wireless in the the rooms. I will say-the people were very nice in the hotel-the front desk person seemed a bit rushed and really had no interest in being there.Great one night the thing we got to leave our car at the hotel for two week for free!Friendly staff, top notch decor and facilities, and great proximity to Sea-Tac. I always try and stay here when passing through Seattle.We stayed at this hotel as it was close to the airport for our early morning flight. Although there was a queue at check in the staff offered us warm cookies and appologised for the delay. We were given a free room upgrade (we are Hilton Honors members). The room was a bit basic and dated but it was inexpensive and we could leave our car in their car park while we were on holiday. Shuttle to the airport every 20 mins 24 hours. The restaurant also had good food (we were given a $10 per person coupon to use in the restaurant from the hotel). Friendy waiter/waitress staff.Received a great deal on this hotel by bidding on Priceline. I didn't have a car so Airport, Light Rail and many restaurants are in walking distance. They do have an airport shuttle. The staff were very accomodating and I loved the chocolate chip cookie at check in. My room was clean and nice but seemed motel like away from the tower. Maybe I got the cheap seats being a priceline customer. Anyway, I requested a non-smoking room but the floor smelled like the stench of smoke. At least my room didn't reak otherwise I would of tried to change rooms. I just wish the smokers had their own wing. Other than that issue, the hotel is nice and staff was great.I stayed here with my niece as she was on an overnight,9 hour layover. I wasn't sure what to pick because I have heard nightmare stories about some of the hotels near SeaTac airport. Everything from the reservation process to the fresh baked cookies at check-in to room service and shuttle service was handled spectacularly. The room was decorated well, the bed and the linens were top notch, and the room and bathroom were spotless. They clearly are customer driven and make sure that every need is met. I only stayed for the night but would have been happy to spend a week there. They are a little higher in price than the others in the area, but it is worth spending an extra 25 or 30 bucks to sleep in a place that is comfortable with people there waiting to handle all your needs.We always choose this hotel when traveling. The shuttle is a great service to airport, and we leave our car in the Hotels Lot while we are away. Our last trip offered an unexpected challenge. Great room, location etc. but in the early morning as I was to shower, we realized the water to the shower was not connected. Maintence diassembled the plumbing at 6am and we asked that they leave and let us get ready. Sponge shower and we were on to our plane. When we arrived in DC, I emailed Doubletree's main office. They were responsive and creditied our room charge back to our account. I will continue to stay at this Hotel and appreciate the professional manner of the management of Doubletree,I had a quick stay here last week for one night. The good news - the hotel is very close to the airport with a 24hr shuttle to the airport. My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting.
The not so good news - food at the hotel was OK. I believe there are better options in walking distance from the hotel.Again, I had a good experience with this hotel. I can always depend on it being a moderately priced hotel, clean, with friendly and accommodating staff. We ate in the restaurant and they were very nice in fixing me a Cobb salad that wasnt on the dinner menu when I asked about it. Good food. We stay there on the "" park and fly"" special so we don't have to get up so early to make our plane. My only on-going complaint is no free wifi in the room but this time I had my 3G phone with me so I didn't need it.I've stayed here a couple of times. The chocolate chip cookies are always a treat. The rooms are clean and nicely appointed. I used the computer in the lobby to print my boarding pass. The shuttle is convenient and reliable. It is on a busy street and I didn't see a restaurant within walking distance so I ate in the lobby. It was fine.We have stayed at this hotel several times in the family suite ( 2 bedrooms/1 king and 2 queen beds). Love the warm chocolate chips cookies and the service has always been outstanding. Excellent morning breakfasts and the airport shuttle runs every 15 minutes but we have made the 10 minute walk numerous times to the airport terminal.We were very pleased with the DoubleTree hotel room. 
For plane spotting, I'd recommend the uppermost NW corner room. The rooms was as soundproof as possible but if the noise of planes bothers you, you might want to get a room on the other side from the airport.
TV on a swivel that can swing between the comfy King bed and the comfy lounger/couch. Wolfgang Puck coffee & individual coffee maker - not bad for hotel room coffee. Largest balcony and the most windows I've ever had in a hotel room. Beware your modesty as the enclosed glass elevator is only about 20 feet away and they can see into the room if they're looking. 
The pool area is beautiful but was a tad cold - if it was heated it wasn't warm enough for us to get in on a cool February evening. The hot tub was just perfect, though. 
oh, and you get a fresh baked cookie upon arrival!Stayed there for two nights during a business visit near the airport. Check-in was quick and friendly. Rooms nicely furnished, typical chain hotel style but absolutely clean and sufficiently equipped. Breakfast buffet was okay but could have been better for the price. Although there is a regular shuttle service from the airport it took more than 30 minuten for the bus to arrive at the airport. 
Altogether a conveniently located hotel for a reasonable price.Stayed here for a night on the way back from Hawaii on a very short layover with my family of five. Arrived around 9 and the shuttle service was the best part about the stay. Very convenient, friendly driver and quick ride from airport. Check-in took a while since everyone getting off the shuttle checks in at once.
We reserved a ""family room"" that had a room with two double beds and a connecting room with a king bed, but only one bathroom. Room was a great size but this is an older property and our room was at the very end of a series of hallways and confusing walkways and elevators to reach; I'm guessing one of the older rooms. It had a stale smell and was in need of renovation both in the rooms and bathroom. Bed comforters looked old and dirty. 
Went down to the restaurant to eat, since we hadn't eaten dinner and kids were starving. Even though we arrived toward the end of their posted hours you could tell they didn't want to serve us and we were not welcomed warmly. Food was ok. Bar area hopping, but kids not allowed to eat in the bar area.
Shuttle back to airport for early morning flight was again perfect. Would not stay at this hotel again unless it was needed for a very short overnight stay. I'm sure there are better properties in the area.I found this hotel the way I find almost all my short-notice domestic hotels: through Hotwire. As usual, I was pretty happy. It was late at night and I needed two things ~ an airport shuttle and a reasonably nice, clean, comfortable, safe place to get a good night's rest. This hotel affords all that. 
It's a sprawling property, though, so you'll joke with your friends later that the walk from the front desk to your room takes longer than the ride to/from the airport. I had made that remark myself and then overheard someone else quip the same thing.
I'd certainly stay here again.One night stopover before heading to London, Hotel is very close to the airport. Hotel shuttle is very convenient, very comfy bed.. restaurant located in the lobby.. Our room is on the lower floor facing the parking lot, no biggy.. pool is big..This hotel is too spread out and it is frustrating finding space to unload your bags in the small entrance way. Ask for a room on the ground floor near the lobby unless you crave a workout befoe your flight. The staff works hard to please and really is the difference between a lousy or good stay. Free internet and printing in the lobby and the still great warm chocolate chip cookies on check in. There is a Dennys across the street and if you miss the shuttle the airport is an easy 10 min waik. Bid $60.00 on priceline for a room.Hotel is very close the the airport and room was comfortable. Had a huge mirror in the bathroom that was well light around the edges. Wolfgang Puck coffee was available for the in room coffee maker, My room was in the tower on the 8th floor and had a balcony. Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax. If you have a AAA membership they will give you 25% off. That's where I parked.We have stayed at several Seatac airport hotels, all acceptable. This trip we needed a quick access to the airport with wheelchair accessibility and this was it. After this stay we will only stay here in the future when at Seatac. They not only are wheelchair accessible, but have an ADA van and very courteous staff that doesn't act put-out at having to help disabled guests. The hotel itself is very nice, we were given a very recently updated room in the tower. The restaurant and bar restaurant are better than average and again great staff. My husband was quite happy with the clam chowder he ordered at the bar after a late night arrival, and that's saying something! The beds were very comfortable, room large enough for wheelchair, and bathroom clean. All good!We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased. We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels. The rooms were very spacious, modern and clean. The shuttle was an extremely convenient as well. 
I would highly recommend the Doubletree and plan on staying here again on our next trip.First let me start by giving myself credibility. I've worked retail and areas of hospitality for 6 years now. Three in management- and I genuinely bow down to this doubletree by Hilton. Seatac area has no shortage of hotels with easy airport access. The amount of service at the front desk and from all hotel staff for that matter is untouchable. Pule was the gentleman that greeted me at front desk. He was courteous, remembered me from my travel over 6 months ago and created a personalized experience. Everyone knows traveling can be quite an ordeal and these guys really get it! Always have had a clean room ready for me, always attentive and polite service, and always a warm fresh cookie. The little things set hotels apart these days and I will never stay at another hotel in the seatac area. The shuttles are also prompt and quiet. The driver places your luggage on board instead of throwing it carelessly in the back. (as I've experienced in other hotels) I highly reccomend this hotel and am sure everyone will receive as good as service as myself!During a three-day blizzard enforced stay, while the hotel was completely full, overworked and understaffed because of the transport hazards, I never once encountered a cross employee. I saw management bussing and waiting on tables, and desk clerks worked double and triple shifts, but every one of them had a smile for me. Just imagine how great a team they must be when all is functioning normally!No internet in rooms or in business meeting rooms unless you pay a fee yet it was free in the lobby and lounge areas. Prices at Lounge and breakfast cafe were on the high end but other restaurants with better prices are in walking distance. Over all staff attitude was slightly stuffy.Expecting the Doubletree name to be better quality.
The room was okay, but not as clean as one would expect.
And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge!
Our room was reserved well in advance, with no mention of a parking fee for their guests!
Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay.
I will not stay in a Doubletree again.Having stayed in other Doubletree Hotels and been really impressed, I was disappointed in this location. I stayed in the ""5th Wing"" which is an annex building set apart from the main hotel towers. The room was old, smelled old, and was even kind-of dirty. I thought the room service choices and quality were REALLY bad - especially for the crazy-high prices. Plus, and I do realize this may seem minor to some, but none of the pictured items on the menu were actually ON THE MENU. So, there I was looking at a lovely dish that I wanted to try, and it wasn't available. Why bother? Anyway, staff seemed friendly and helpful, the hotel was quiet, and generally the stay was ok. Still, I felt like I was at an older Best Western with the 80's decor/linens, but I was paying A LOT more for this room. I recommend staying at one of the Best Westerns that are located very close to this Doubletree Hotel and save yourself some money.The quality of the room is not as high as the previous two stays at the hotel, when we were previously located on the 10th and 12th floors of the Tower. However, this 5th floor Tower two queen bed room was MUCH better than the first room we were assigned which we refused to stay in. 
I have stayed with this same hotel 3 times now and this third time I was initially assigned into an awful room. It was located, as memory serves me correctly, on the 3rd floor in the 4th building. Never mind, it was a very difficult and a very, long walk to access these rooms but when I opened the door the room was completely unacceptable. First, the prices--room rates have increased--since my last stay in June 2011. The price was 119.00 per King and now with the AAA card was approx. 144.00. The function that I was attending in Seattle was housed at the Holiday Inn Express hotel for 89.00 an evening and we attendees were reimbursed for the stay. I opted NOT to stay there but at the Doubletree Inn instead. When I entered the room originally assigned to us in the 4th building third floor, it was no better or cleaner than a roadside Holiday Inn Express. Old, tired looking, smelly and small, scuffed up and a very, very long walk from the front desk and restaurant. More of a motel room one would find along the roadside of a highway.
I then called the front desk however, no answer after 20 rings. I then struggled with my luggage all the way back to the front desk and my husband and I insisted on being located in the Tower section whereas this is the area I have always stayed previously. The gentleman, I believe front desk manager, agreed to change us to the new location and we were appreciative but I can assure you that I will NEVER stay in any rooms other than the Tower section at this hotel. These are referred to as the Deluxe rooms. The room we finally settled in the Tower 5th floor had several issues that were wrong. The TV remote control was not working for my husband and he called for another. The other issue being the air fan in the ceiling above the second or foyer sink made a rattling noise and was very loud and unsettling in which we had to adjust the temperature setting in the room to make it stop. Lastly, the toilet handle easily gets stuck and the toilet will run, continuously and loudly, until you return to move the handle.
The food in the hotel is quite good. We had the Halibut and the Salmon and began with the chowder soup and the food has always been consistent and tasty even at our previous stays. 
Lastly, it is ridiculous that this hotel charges for Internet—WiFi-- service for guests. 
Ridiculous and certainly, if this is the case in the future, I may very well look into another choice for accommodations. The hotel should pay close attention to maintenance as it appears to have declined since my last visits.Hotel was quiet, clean and easy to get the free shuttle to airport. If you have a long layover or need a quick hotel near SeaTac this is great. Checking in and out was smooth and the room was very nice, flat screen TV and bedding was comfortable.We did a reverse park and fly, parking prior to our 2 week trip to Costa Rica. We had to wait a bit for the valet to park our car, and then there was a small fender bender with the shuttle as we pulled out. They got us another shuttle though, and we'd luckily left plenty of time. 
On our return the message said that shuttles come frequently. However it was very late at night so none were coming. When we called again and asked for one it came quickly. So don't just wait if it's late - call.
The front sek service was quick and friendly. No complaints there.
Our room was spacious enough, the bed was comfy and it was quiet.It could really use some updates though. The carpet was old and stained and the bathroom just had a new counter and fixtures added to an old room. The tub was old and the toilet a big ancient thing that barely flushed. The lighting was dreadful. 
It was ok for a night, but I was a bit surprised as we purposely spent more to get a better hotel than last time. This one didn't include the quick eay breakfast buffet, which we missed. We came back from a Hilton in Costa Rica that was much more modern! 
Would we stay again? Maybe, but only for a better price. There are lots of airport hotels to choose from.Graciously greeted & promptly checked-in by front desk staff. Excellent room atmosphere & comfort. Just down the road from the airport.We live about two hours and a ferry ride from the airport and always stay here when we have an early morning flight. We get the stay and jet package so we park for a week for only $30.00. It is somewhat dated but comfortable enough and the shuttle is very reliable.My hubby and I stay here every time we come and go from Seattle (which seems like a lot seeing as we are from Juneau). Just about every time we've come through, we've been able to get an upgrade. We love that the hotel is so close to the airport, you don't even need the shuttle if you want to stretch you legs a bit. The last time we stayed, we were in what I think was the ""older"" wing, and even then, the carpets and everything was immaculate. The newer wings and the towers are beautiful. I absolutly love their beds...soooooo comfortable. We would highly recommend this place, even if you're staying for a few days. This isn't a low end hotel, so I expected extra fees. Just seems to be what the nicer hotels do. So yes, internet and parking are extra, unless you get an upgraded room, where sometimes wi-fi is free. And of course, the nice warm fresh cookies on arrival...I'm a definite sucker for those! Over all, this is a beautiful hotel with very clean and comfortable rooms. We love it!The hotel is a very well cared for hotel. BEWARE of the extras fees such as wireless internet in your room is $15.00 for 24 hr rental per IP address. So if a family stays with smart phones and laptops it could be quite expensive. They charge $20+ per day for parking. The other amedities are excellent like the quality of the beds and bedding, LCd TVs but if you are in one of the wing rooms you could have a long walk to the central lobby area.After a miserable day at Sea-Tac, we thought the Doubletree would be heaven. Well, not quite. The hotel is divided into different wings. The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty. The decor and bathroom are straight from the 70's!! ( Liekthe Brady bunch!). Rooms are not particularly posh or large. Ours was kind of dingy, definitely in need of a remodeling. My wife and I stayed only 1 night before flying out of Sea-Tac the next morning. Hotel was fine for our purposes, but I wouldn't have wanted a longer stay there. 
Beds were very comfortble . Free internet access in the lobby only and open 24 hrs. . Pool and whirlpool were nice, but would prefer 24 hr. access like health club. Room service was typically expensive . We ate at both the lounge and the cafe and food was average at best, but the service VERY GOOD! (Eben the bus boy made sure we were served well)
The front desk staff was also very good!
The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture. The room room's AC was working fine and it was pretty quite. No airplane or traffic sounds. The free airport shuttle runs every 15 mins or so and really helped us catch our flight the next morning. 
So overall you get what you pay for. I got a good night sleep.Nice airport hotel. Front desk staff is (almost always) friendly & helpful. Tower rooms are great - spring for a corner king with huge wrap-around deck. Rooms are very comfy with nice amenities. HBO is free. Typical for Seattle Airport, they charge for parking if you have a car. Want a drink? You may want to bring your own -- service can be spotty in the lounge. Long waits appear to be the norm even when not that busy. Good sized outdoor pool & hot tub. Suites are very nice & have oversized showers & deep soaking tubs (no jetted tubs though). If you're HiltonHonors Gold internet is free; otherwise they charge except in the public lobby area.I happened upon Doubletree when I decided to sleep in a hotel near Seatac to avoid driving there first thing in the morning, I called and told them I needed a room for the night and asked if they knew where I could park near the airport, They offered us a room for the night, a 10 minute shuttle to the airport in the morning and parking for 14 days for $169.
Here's the way it works: park your car securely in their garage and upon return call them from the airport. In the time it takes you to take the shuttle back to the hotel your car is ready for you,I had booked this hotel due to my previous terrific experience with a very nice room and bath. Upon arrival, I requested the same room as previously, if available. I was informed that entire floor was currently being re-furbished and there were no rooms of that quality available. He hoped re-furbishing would be complete in January. Interesting, as the beautiful room I stayed in previously was very new-gorgeous bath and soaking tub. I can't imagine those rooms would need refurbishing! I was then given another ""Hilton Honors"" room. I arrived to a room on the very ground floor that had a glass door that opened to the outside parking area. Due to security, I did not think this was a good idea for a single female traveler, however, I did not want to 'make waves' and request another room as I was only there for one night. Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these ""Hilton Honors"" rooms really need refurbishing. I had such a great experience the first time, I am disappointed-and-as a single female traveler, will never stay on the ground floor of any hotel again, if at all possible.My husband and I stayed overnight last week, between flights. The check-in experience was excellent, including the hot cookie. The reception area was beautifully decorated for Christmas, with trees and lights, and a blazing fire. Our room was in the Tower. We were on a high floor, facing trees, and found everything extremely quiet. Very little noise from the airport, and no noise from other rooms. It looked as if the management had sensibly spread the room occupants out along the corridor, to ensure quietness: is this a policy with the hotel? If so, it is to be commended. Special thanks to the friendly bartender, who found some fresh fruit and fresh milk for us to buy. The shuttle to the airport was efficiently run, with very courteous and helpful drivers. A pity that there is no free internet access in the rooms. When clients are tired, they do not wish to make the journey to the foyer to use the wi-fi there. However, I would definitely stay here again.Across from Airport, free shuttle every 20 minutes. The most polite and helpful staff I've EVER encountered as a whole. Very clean. Short 10 min walk to light rail system to downtown. Nice lounge and really decent food. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The rooms in the back overlooking the lake are the quietest; they graciously moved me after my request. There is a bit of noise from airport/street if you are in the towers facing the street so I moved. But they hauled all my things for me. Large property and walk can be long to the rooms but bell staff is very efficient. Pool was heated; hot tub nice and hot and everything was great. Nicely decorated especially at Christmas. The room rate was excellent buy rather than staying downtown and the light train system is so easy to use it's a bargain.Had a 2 night stay here in February of 2011. Room was very nice, outdoor pool and hot tub facility looked great but had limited time and did not use. Fitness facility is decent and clean. Would stay here againLocated within a few miles of Sea-Tac this is a very large hotel with a Starbucks, gift shop, meeting rooms, breakfast room, bar and dining room. The food was a little expensive-$13 for a burger and $12 for an omelette alone. However it was good enough.
I had a spacious and clean suite with fridge, microwave, nice sized table and a comfortable bed. I loved that the heating system was quiet. I had plently of outlets, but my suite on the 12th floor had recently been remodeled. The walk out balcony was a nice surprise.
It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings. From the wings it was a bit of a hike to the restaurants and front desk.
Nice pool and fitness areas. 
Parking is expensive at $25 for valet and $21.50 for self-park per night. Free shuttle to and from airport helps. Verify internet price-not free.
Good jumping off spot for wherever you want to go.I had a last minute business trip to Seattle and didn't know the city. I looked up hotels by the airport and decided on the Doubletree Hotel because I like to stay in high rise hotels which is what the photo showed. When my traveling companion and I pulled up to the hotel it was very pretty and had balconies which I like. The interior of the lobby was beautiful with a huge fire in the fireplace. We didn't arrive at the hotel until almost 11:00 PM but it didn't take a few minutes to check in. I was shocked to learn that the hotel has several pods or wings attached to it with rooms. We were in building five which was a long distance to the main hotel. When we parked we couldn't figure out which door to go in and we walked for about 20 minutes before finding our room. If we had wanted to walk back to the main hotels it would have taken forever and a very good map.
As I was walking down the hall to my room, I noticed this loud humming noice in the ceiling. I figured it had something to do with the pipes or wiring in the ceiling. I stepped into my room and was very surprised. The room was huge with a balcony which looked out onto a lake. The bathroom was big with two vanities which made it nice if you were traveling with another person. I could still hear the humming in my room which was very loud in the bathroom area. I thought about asking for another room but it was already midnight and I needed to get up early in the morning. The bed was very nice and soft with nice linens but I couldn't sleep. I often travel with earplugs so I put them in but I could still hear the humming. I finally put a pillow over my ears along with the earplugs and went to sleep. 
The next morning I could still hear the loud humming and was happy to check out of the room. I went to meet my traveling companion in his room to meet him before checking out. His room was not as nice as mine. It seemed old and outdated. The balcony to the room was right on the parking lot which would be a privacy issue to me. The check out was quick and we were able to get out boarding passes to the plane in the lobby. I later learned from people who live in Seattle that the place to stay is downtown. The only way I would stay at this hotel again is if I could stay in the main building.My stays at the Doubletree have been too short but always positive. I frequently overnight at this hotel as I make connections and my requirements are a hotel that I can quickly get to, quickly check into and out of and a quiet location. The Doubletree meets all of those requirements.
I wish there were more food options at 5:30am and some way to use the food voucher I receive at check in. But I do enjoy this hotel, even though my stays are short (less than 8 hours in most cases)We have used this hotel for our Seattle visits quite a bit and we keep returning because of how well they do everything. From upgrading us, to clean and comfy rooms, and to the excellent response time if we ever encounter any issues with our rooms. 
Let's be honest folks, issues can happen to anyone. No hotel is immune from it but it's how they handle those issues that bring the cream to the top. Doubletree Seatac always rises to the top.
This place is perfect for everyone. 
OK, now the ""not so good"". Very, very minor stuff for us.
Have Starbucks stay open later in the lobby. Checking in after a very long drive at 1pm, a nice cup of coffee and that warm cookie would be perfect while getting settled in our room. 
If that's not possible, then it's time to replace those wolfgang coffee makers. Those are ancient and in need of a garbage can.
Time to upgrade, like most hotels, to the K cup systems. 
Again, these are such minor things and would never keep us from coming back to our favorite Seattle hotel.Right across from airport. Older building with an odd design, but the rooms are updated, clean and comfortable. 
Good wifi signal, fast enough for video. 
Decent fitness center w/full dumbbell set to 50 lbs. Several treadmills and ellipticals
If you don't like to walk with bags, get a room close to the lobby. I was in wing 4 and it was a bit of a walk and two different elevators to get to my room, but I the chocolate chip cookie gave me the energy I needed.Nice well appointed hotel. Just across street from airport. very nice rooms and some restaraunts in the areas, enough to satisfy most people. Transportation every 20 min to irport. Rooms are quiet and nice beds. Pool is excellent although the workout room is at the back of the hotel, I guess it's okay since you have to walk to get there. restaraunt in hotel is okay but has hotel prices. Cookies are GREAT! If you want to go into downtown Seattle you can go across street to get on a bus and get right downtown, it's really easy. Overall has a very good rating but it is Hilton prices.This hotel embraces its role as an airport hotel and fufils its purpose very well. Staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are decent, and it's very close to the airport. The airport shuttle runs round the clock (every twenty minutes) and is very efficient. The hotel's extended parking option provides great value.I stayed here for two nights before departing on a long international trip from Seatac. The shuttle to and from the airport was timely and appreciated, and check-in was easy. The staff was very friendly. The rooms are dated, but functional and clean. I ate in two of the hotel restaurants and both meals were decent, with the usual gigantic American portions. I would stay here again if I needed to stay a hotel near Seatac airport.My husband and I stayed here because it is across the street from SEATAC, in Seattle. It is a beautiful property upon pulling up. My husband checked in and came back with a map of where our room was. It was in the furthest building away from the main lobby. Once we got to the building there was no lift, ramp, luggage carrier or bellhop to assist with carrying luggage up the stairs. My husband had to go back and forth to get the luggage and carry it down the hall to the last room on the hallway. There was a lobby on each floor and a exercise room on our floor. The lobbies had no facilities nor televisions. There were dingy discarded chairs. There was no one from the hotel anywhere in that building. We felt abandoned by the hotel. It was unkept, spider webs and all on the windows and on the balcony over the water. In the morning when we checked out we had to do the same thing with the luggage with no help whatsoever and inadequate lighting outside. Just not a very personable or client friendly place. Furthermore, there was no free internet access in the rooms. I called down and it was $15 per day. I was told I could come to the lobby in the main building and it was free there. Really??? The room's heating system was confused at best. It would go from air to heat without warning. We froze most of the night and had hot flashes the rest. Slept on the plane home, which I never do.Over the past month I’ve stayed twice at the Doubletree Seattle Airport and was happy with both stays. The hotel seemed large for a Doubletree, but not overwhelmingly so. Staff were helpful and pleasant. It’s certainly a step above other Doubletrees I’ve stayed at recently. The rooms are sufficiently roomy and were clean and well-kept. This is the first hotel I’ve stayed at for a long while where there was actually a light over the bathtub/shower: it’s a nice touch, since so often the curtain blocks the light and makes it dark in the shower.
The convenience to the airport cannot be overstated: if the weather is nice and you’re up for it, it’s just a quick ten-minute walk from door-to-door. Of course there’s a shuttle that runs regularly but being able to walk to the airport is nice if you don’t want to walk or would like some fresh air before your flight. You can see the hotel from the tarmac and, if you get a room facing in that direction, you can see the tarmac and terminal from the hotel.
As Hilton Diamond I wasn’t upgraded either time, but, then again, I never am at any Hilton Family property. 
This is a good place to stay if convenience to Sea-Tac is important to you and also if you need to be in that part of the Seattle area.I spent two nights at this hotel while on business. It is extremely convenient to the airport. They run continuous shuttles. The room was fine, perhaps a little dated but very clean. The beds were comfy. It is a very large hotel so be prepared to walk to your room. I ate at the bar and the restaurant. Both were good. This is a safe selection and you will not be unhappy.I stayed at this location for two nights whilst on a business trip. Everything was wonderful! I was given a room in the ""towers"" on the 7th floor and faced the back which was very quiet. The bathroom amenities are upgraded and plentiful. The washrooms had two sinks one in the bathroom area and the other outside, a nice tough. The food at the hotel was also excellent! The breakfast hashbrowns were greasy and to die for! The shuttle service to the airport leaves on the hour and half hour and were kind enough to drive me to a location a few miles away for a business meeting. I would recommend this location!I needed a place to crash for a few hours during an overnight layover and the Doubletree looked great, being so close to the airport. It is literally 5 minutes from the airport entrance, so this was great for my 5AM flight.
The rooms are decent, probably average for most Doubletree hotels nowadays. The room and bathroom were clean, which is appreciated when I just want to get into the room and get to sleep. My only complaint is the property and rooms seem a bit tired. Other than the bed and bathroom everything seemed a bit worn out. Not a real fault, because everything was still in good order.
Overall if I had to spend another night near the airport I wouldn't look anywhere else. A warm cookie, clean room and a great bed is all I could ask for.Large comfortable bed with excellent bedding. Great staff. Only downfall was that a $19 Saturday breakfast was priced out of my range.We flew into Seattle and arrived after midnight. After driving up and down International Bl. one time we decided on checking in at the Doubletree. All the other lodging options seemed to have dimly lit parking lots next to seedy businesses or something. It's an ok hotel by any other standards but nice compared to what's close by.I arrived late at night and was flustered by the confusing and poorly lit parking options. I was staying at the hotel for under 8 hours and yet the clerk who checked me in was still encouraging me to pay for the valet parking. At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet! 
The hotel room was fine, but I am not sure that this was worth it. I am a loyal Hilton customer and am glad to get the points but this hotel seems better-suited to guests staying for several days, not for someone who just wants a place to crash before an early flight.This was the last of three hotels we stayed at on our trip. I was surprised that such a large hotel charged for internet access. Much smaller ones offered it for free.
We arrived way early (9am) and thankfully, they let us check in early. 
The shuttle to the airport was great. It's about a half mile from the Light Link rail from the hotel, so the shuttle was great! The rail takes about a half hour to get to the Universtiy Street stop (near the waterfront).We stayed at the Doubletree by Hilton Seattle Airport on the evening of Saturday September 18th. We flew-in to Seattle from St Louis and arrived at the airport around 12:15pm. We finally found Island 3 (the airport is under construction but basically, for now, you walk across the landing and take the elevator down, like you are going toward the parking garage). The big, comfy shuttle bus arrived and I was a surprised at how nice and big it was. The bus had about ten airline crew members it was dropping off. It picked-up us, some more airline crew members, and a few other guests. 
We arrived at the hotel in just a few minutes (as it is literally sitting on the airport runway). We were slow getting off the bus so we were last to check-in but from the very start, they gave us a wonderful impression – they had four or five ladies checking people in as fast as possible – and they were fast! In less than five minutes we had two warm chocolate chip cookies and two room key cards. Our room was at the VERY VERY back of the hotel also known as wing 5, fourth floor. Yes, it is a long walk. My husband & I are exercise freaks and it shows and we made the walk just fine, no problem… with lots of very nice maids offering us advice/assistance along the way if we got lost. It was easy breezy and the quiet room and the lake view were worth the little walk. 
We were going to use the free shuttle (which leaves every hour at like 2:05, 3:05, etc) to go to the Westfield/Southcenter mall which is HUGE but my sister, who lives in the area, just picked us up and we all went to the Cheesecake Factory (attached to the mall) for dinner. We walked around the mall after and hubby bought some sandals. We got back to the hotel and stopped in the gift shop to buy soda or water but decided not too when we realized the soda machines (and ice machine, btw) next to our room were cheaper – only $1.25 in the machines versus $1.99 in the store – not a big deal but fyi. 
I used the Internet to update my blog and instead of paying for 24-hour usage, I just put in my room number for one hour usage at $4.95 – plenty of time to update my blog and saved me $10 (it's 14.95 for 24-hour usage). The Internet was wireless and VERY fast. They have wired hookups on the desk area also if you need them. 
We had prepaid for this room and got a FANTASTIC rate for a smoking king. At check-in we had to show a credit card for a $50 hold for incidentals. The next morning our final bill – for $4.95 – was under our door. They had charged the card we gave them for the Internet access and released the other $45. Easy breezy. 
We had a great view, a comfy bed, a quiet room, a decent sized balcony, great service, and a nice no-brainer stay. We would stay here again in a second. Also, we walked by a Starbucks inside the hotel that seemed popular, two restaurants, a bar, a huge outdoor pool (it must be heated?) and a very large hot tub that was steaming since it was cool outside when we stayed here. Everything looked to be maintained very well and I cannot say enough nice things about this hotel. For the record, I am a hotel snob and we try to only stay at Hilton properties. I am a little surprised at some of the other reviews saying this hotel is “old” and etc.
Also – directly across from the hotel and an easy-easy walk away is a Denny’s, 711, Taco Bell, several other fast food places, and a Liquor & Wine store (Seattle does not sell hard liquor on Sundays, fyi).
My only complaint… the next morning we needed to be at the airport before 7am to meet our shuttle driver to take us into downtown Seattle. The bus driver the next morning was cranky and in a bad mood. There was a big crowd (with luggage) waiting for him when he arrived and apparently, he wasn’t in the mood to do his job. My husband got ticked at him for ignoring him and saying something about this being another “bad Monday” – I wish we had not tipped him at all, frankly. This was the only negative thing I can say as the bus driver we had the previous day was wonderful. We did, however, make it to the airport easily and in plenty of time – despite the driver again complaining when he had to drop us off first and he realized he had piled my bag under two others. He was the only sour note to a sweet stay!this hotel was so comfortable. After commuting back and fort from florida if too tired to drive back to my destination i always stay at this dbl tree. I have never once had a bad nights sleep in these beds. I love the big warm cookies in the evening. They never seem to slap my hand if I grab 2 or 3...recommendation goes to this hotel over others!This room was one of the most comfortable rooms I've stayed at in a long time. Cushy bed, flat screen tv, great water pressure. Room was quiet and the shuttle to the airport runs 24 hours. I was there by myself and felt very safe. On the downside, I just recently tried to make a reservation for another night with my husband, and they want to charge $10 for the second person. (Yet they gave me two queens)My BFF plus two other friends and I were planning a trip to the west coast. The biggest decision was how to get from Seattle to Vancouver, BC. When looking at the various options, we wanted something different. We found a fantastic deal which included a hotel stay in Seattle and an overnight cruise to Vancouver. Our hotel was the Doubletree by Hilton Seattle Airport. After a rocky start finding the right shuttle, everything else was fantastic. We arrived at the hotel and were warmly greeted by the Front Desk Staff and given warm cookies. Wish they came without nuts. The room was very nice with lots of space. We even had a little balcony which we would have used if the weather had been nicer. That evening we enjoyed a cocktail in the bar and the bartender was fantastic. The next morning our server for breakfast was very attentive. 
The only downside was the gentleman manning the concierge desk. We were asking directions to the Public Market and a pub we were interested in trying. He kept trying to get us interested in a certain fish restaurant. We ended up asking a local person who gave us correct information and even helped us get on the right train.
We would definitely stay there again.I recently spent 4 nights here. The check-in was wonderful, the staff great, and the hotel itself was nice. 
The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers). And they add a $3 tip on top of the 18% (and then all the regular taxes are there, too). So a burger and soup were $32, and it was a very. VERY average burger. Total rip-off with the excess charges.
I did not use daily housekeeping and was able to get what I needed when I saw them in the halls. And the women I met were very, very friendly and polite. 
But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected. I did email Rissa, who took a day and a half (and two emails) to respond to me. She said all the blahblahblah and offered to change rooms, but I was halfway through my stay and changing rooms is a pain. This was a business trip so I was not looking for compensation on the room. I thought she may care a bit more with the pics as proof, but I guess they hear complaints all day. I did make sure to include all the positive I had to say as well.
The internet fees are a HUGE scam-- $12-$15 for 24 hours. There is no way that they aren't banking money here. 
Parking is another point of contention but I did not park so not really going worry about this one.
Overall, if this were MY money, I would NOT stay here. With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room. They don't even have microwaves or fridges in the rooms. Even most motels give you a microwave.While this hotel might be good for many people, I don't think it was right for us. There are other places very near by that cost less and are less of a hassle. 
Let's start with the shuttle. Perhaps our negative experience with this colored the rest of our stay. I had called the hotel with questions about the shuttle and both the recording and the human told me to go to Island 1 or 3. The bus came regularly and had a big number 1 on it. It was 11:30 pm (2:30am to us) when we got to Island 3. It is really big and had several stops all labeled Island 3 Courtesy Shuttles. Not knowing which to choose we stood by the phone bank. We spent nearly 30 minutes staring into the bright headlights of the many courtesy vehicles searching for that Number 1. Nothing. Finally, I spot the Doubletree name in fairly small letters on a bus. There is no number. I leap into the street frantically waving and the bus stops. The driver tells us he is full and we will have to stand. Standing on the bus and getting to the hotel is preferable to another half hour of standing on the sidewalk and being blinded. It actually turned out well because last on was first off. 
Check in went quickly and smoothly since we are Hilton Honors members and there was a special line. (There must have been 30 parties behind us and I feel very sorry for them.) Our room was a reasonable distance from check in and there was a well-marked map on the key envelope. We needed it. Our room was fine. It was fairly large and overlooked a parking area and another building. We liked that the bathroom had two sinks. Airport noise was minimal. We slept well.
We had $10 vouchers for breakfast because of our Diamond status. This would cover the continental breakfast buffet but including hot food would cost an additional $7 per person. When looking at ordering from the menu as an option, we found that tea and juice alone cost $8. One of the buffets was the only reasonably priced option. The yogurt was amazingly good and had many great toppings. The croissant was stale. This inconsistency in food quality was present in the hot offerings too.
On the positive side, we had been told at check in that we should get a fruit and cheese plate but the kitchen was closed. The desk arranged for us to get it to go before we checked out. The shuttle back to the airport to pick up our rental car was excellent. There was no number 1on the bus but we saw a second bus which did have a number easily visible.
We chose the Doubletree for this trip because the price was the same as a nearby Hampton but only because we did not have to park a car. That would have cost us $20.This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great. Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland. The hotel restaurant was nice enough, but again, bland; the food was nicely presented but had no taste. The first night there I did not hear any airport noise, but the second night, I clearly heard the planes. I also used the business center, but the computers were slow and ran an old version of software; one printer worked but the other didn't. To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place.We have been staying at this location for twenty-seven years, even before it was a Doubletree. The main reason we return is dependability. The hotel has been consistently updated and maintained. The lobby and staff are first class, and by the time we find our room in the sprawling maze that is the Doubletree, we are always pleased with the clean rooms and appointments. It fits its star rating, and can't be beat for convenient location next to the airport. We have walked from the airport to the hotel on many evenings after a late arrival. They, of course, do have a dependable and friendly shuttle. A recent change has been increased parking lot security, which is convenient and easy to access with the required pass.Although this trip was for a very sad occasion. The staff were accommodating. They allowed us a early, early check in to a large top floor outer room with two extremely comfortable queen beds. We flew Alaska air and this hotel was maximum 10 min. walk from airport to lobby. The new light rail was 1 1/2 blocks away and a 25 min. trip to downtown Seattle. The food was good both in the Restaurant and the breakfast cafe and the portions large. (Being a Californian I'm used to big white plates with bird scraps.) This hotel and staff made a hard trip very easy. Thanks to all.We took a Park'n'Fly package which allows us to stay 1 night and park our vehicle for up to 7 days. This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling. 
The Front staff were friendly and efficient in getting us checked in and taken care of. Even got free cookies - wasn't expecting that. The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms. Use the map the front desk provide and you will have no issues. 
Our room was nice and clean and on the back side (away from street traffic), plus only heard planes when we has the sliding door opened. We didn't have a chance to use the pool, although enticing. We were able to grab a quick bite and coffee at the convenience Starbucks in the lobby on our way out to our flight. We would gladly stay here again!My husband and I stayed at the doubletree for 2 nights and although we had a rough start at this hotel everything was remedied and we ended up really enjoying our stay. Our rough start began with card keys that didn't work. Although this would only be a slight inconvenience in a smaller hotel, the fact that the Doubletree is so large meant we had to actually drive back to the lobby to fix our keys. This also happened the next day. Both times the staff was very apologetic and even offered us more cookies (you always get cookies at check in) The other problem that occurred was a communication problem when I requested a refrigerater to keep my husband's fish frozen but were delivered a small fridge with no freezer compartment. This was nicely overcome when they offered to store his fish in the hotel's freezer. This aspect of the hotel was a real selling point for next time we go to Seattle since we usually go fishing.
Our room was extremely comfortable and although the long walking distance to the rooms may be a negative for some travelers, we don't mind that at all. We had one of the rooms that overlooks the little lake so that was nice as well. The room and bathroom was nice and big with very comfortable beds.
The only real negatives that I would give this hotel is that although it's not a downtown hotel, they still charge for parking and internet. Most airport hotels don't carry these charges so I didn't really check that when I booked.We stayed at the Double Tree prior to going on 2 week hiking vacation. I have nothing but praise for this hotel. The hotel was modern, clean and the room was of an extremely high standard and was situated in ideal location. The free shuttle bus was extremely useful when travelling to the airport to catch the metro link to down town seattle. Overall a very pleasant 2 days stay at this hotelOverall this is a good property. Parts of the hotel are laid-out such that it can be difficult to find your room. My co-workers and I joke about the Doubletree Maze at SEATAC. It takes a few trips to figure it out. The hotel is very close to the airport and sometimes we walk. The van in the morning can be very crowded so get in line early. The coffee bar in the lobby is great and opens at 5. The rooms are comfortable and the cookies are great but getting smaller.This is my favorite place to stay when I need to overnight at SeaTac for an early morning flight. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Free internet access in the lobby, and a nice wine selection at the bar. If you're up for the walk with your luggage, ask for a room overlooking the pond - and listen on the balcony to the frogs croaking through the night. And did I mention the chocolate chip cookies - waaarm chocolate chip cookies upon check-in. It's a bit more than I like to spend, but I enjoy it when I'm there. (EXCEPT - they say they're pet friendly, but with a $75 per night pet charge, I don't consider it ""friendly"" at all.)Don't expect a whole lot here. It is an average airport hotel. Confusing layout. Larger than normal rooms do make things more comfortable. The bathrooms are worn and need updating. The workout rooms are decent - especially the larger one in Building Five.The hotel is a wonderful location for those arriving in Seattle and those heading out of town. The stay, park & fly option was soo easy.. will definitely use this ervice again.On a recent US trip we probably stayed in about 10 hotels and this one wouldn't rank in the top 20!
This is a very large and confusingly laid out hotel. When we found our room we discovered that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and there were dirty towels lying around. We advised reception who promised immediate action. When we returned about 10 hours later nothing had been done. We were offered a change of room and the assistance of a three man team to move. We began loading our luggage ourselves and when no-one arrived I headed to reception to be greeted by one man with our new room key. He made no offer to assist.
No facilities were open early next morning when we were headed for our flight (surprising in such a location where there were lots of people headed for early flights) and although there seem to be a lot of valet staff around, none of them made any effort to assist.
We had decided to go with this hotel to save a small amount of money and as a change from the Cedarbrook lodge we had stayed in a couple of weeks before. Big mistake. On the basis of this experience I will never choose a Doubletree hotel again. It is just not worth the money.The hotel was perfectly fine for a quick stay before or after a Seatac flight. But the $17 breakfast buffet was unnecessarily expensive - just walk across the street and down 1/2 block for some local places at one quarter the price.We stayed here for 1 night before flying overseas. The hotel is well situated near Seatac and there is a free shuttle to and from the airport. The hotel was clean, friendly (free cookies upon arrival), and we found the rooms quite spacious.
We had a fabulous dinner in the lounge and then a large-ish group of us stayed drinking for hours until they closed. The service was super friendly and the atmosphere welcoming and relaxed. It was a very comfortable place to gather.
We would most definitely stay at this hotel again!We stayed at this hotel one night before an Alaska cruise. We arrived very late, were greeted at the desk by a friendly employee who handed us a warm chocolate chip cookie to munch on while we were waiting for our room key. The breakfast in the restaurant was amazing, and the staff was very attentive and friendly. The room was very clean and comfortable. The gift shop was well stocked and very reasonably priced. We would highly recommend this hotel for before and after cruising because it is minutes from the airport and is lovely.We have stayed in many hotels in the Seattle airport area and finally found this gem. The location is great, the beds are the best ever! The shuttle is convenient and the staff are very welcoming and helpful. Thankful we finally found such a great place to stay before our flights.We stayed at the doubletree because we were catching an early flight the next morning, and they had a free shuttle service (takes a little more than 5 minutes). Checking in the night before, the lady at the front desk was a little rude. We booked a room for 2 beds, and she said non were available. We said we wouldn't mind being compensated if you couldn't grant us our booking. She then said, that's ok, we'll give you 2 beds. Got to our room and we probably got a larger than normal room, very nice, impressed. The room was very nice, but could use better customer service.Stayed in the high-rise portion. Room was spacious and clean. Nice size bath. Ate at on-site bar/restaurant which was good. Staff asked family with small child to move to restaurant portion which was the right thing to do. Lobby has PC with printer to check in to airline and print boarding pass. Printer didn't work but able to check in for flight. Complimentary shuttle nice although couldn't fit everyone on a Sunday mid-AM!The front desk staff were very friendly and very helpful. I booked a rate that was a $20 higher but it included breakfast, internet and parking.
As it's so close to the airport they charge for parking so it's worth the extra in the rate for it to be included.
The room was fine. It looks very tiered because they have used browns everywhere, It wasn't actually as bad as it looked at first glance.
It is very close to the airport, rooms on one side are looking directly at the airport gates. You can hear the aircraft taking off from inside the room.Great stay! Only irregularity was one of our bed headboards had fallen off the wall. We fixed it ourselves but found it a bit odd the room was deemed ""ready"" when the headboard was obviously on the ground. Still a nice room & good food.We have stayed here many times and have always enjoyed it. The staff is excellent, although I'd work on the shuttle drivers and parking guys....they tend to worry more about their tips then serving the customer) front desk are always so helpful. We always breeze right thru and they always acknowledge when you walk thru the lobby. I love that. Cookies are excellent too. 
Starbucks in lobby but I wish they would extend the hours. Having it close so early isn't good for serving the customers. I'd make the hours earlier in the morning and later in the day. A lot of folks were in the lobby early for airport and it wasn't even open to serve us. Shame, shame, shame
Rooms are very comfy, very clean and just so quiet. Love the views and always appreciate the upgrades (without asking) as included in being a member of Hhonors.
Like I mentioned earlier, get the parking guys and shuttle drivers to quit worrying about tips. That's a huge turnoff to me. Do it because you love to serve us, not because of the money. The money will come from a geniune service. Trust me, I know.
Love how early we could get in to the gym too to work out before our 5:30am flight. Nothing starts off the day like a great workout.We stayed on a BUSY saturday night. When we arrived 2 of 4 elavators worked (about 2pm). By 6pm only 1 worked! We were on the 9th floor and traveling with a baby so we waited 15 mins one time. next morning still only 1 elavator worked. This is the only negative thing I have to say. Shuttle service to airport was great! Room was clean and comfortable. Service was excellent.Stayed twice in July. The first time was great, stayed in the Tower which is next to the restaurant and Starbucks, very close to thge airport and the shuttle was quick. Room was clean, quiet and comfortable, and the staff was friendly. Stayed a week later and had a different experience. We got an automatic upgrade to a suite for $20 more a night. The suites are a long way from the main lobby. A trainee checked us in and gave poor directions to the room. We had 20 minutes to drive to the room, unload luggage and return without paying for parking. Sounds like plenty of time, right? It took a while to find the building, then went in the wrong entrance and eventually figured out that only one elevator in that building goes to the fifth floor. By the time I got back it was more than 20 minutes so I got charge $20 or so for parking. The family room suites are huge but this room smelled moldy, maybe someone had smoked there, but the bathroom was particularly moldy. They were 100% booked which might explain the poor service. They found a room in the tower and moved us, but our key did not work so I had to go back to the lobby and get a new one. After traveling all day it was very frustrating to take over an hour to check in. The manager came by because we complained and offered us free parking for the night, but he was rude acted like it was our fault the key didn't work (""maybe you put it next to a credit card or cell phone"". No, we didn't, your trainee needs some supervision.) When we checked out the parking was on our bill, so I went to the lobby and the fixed the error. Another thing I found in the fine print: the USA Today is not free anymore, they add $0.75 to the bill unless you opt out at check in. Most people probably don't notice it. Once we got settled the room was nice.We were excited about our trip to Seattle and our stay at the Doubletree until we were checking out - there was a $20+ charge per day for parking that was not disclosed to us by either Expedia or the Hotel at the time of booking our stay or at the time we checked in. We were also surprised at the time we arrived that there was a $15+ charge per day for Wi-Fi. I do not appreciate up-charges that are not disclosed in advance. The accommodations were fine but just ordinary. During our next trip to the Seattle area we will not be staying at the Doubletree nor will we be booking with Expedia.I stayed there recently for three nights on business. The hotel was clean and facilities, while older are nice. I did something dumb and left something there and later spoke with a nice gentleman on the phone who helped me a great deal though his hands seemed a little tie din terms of what he could do. I also though had my iPod stolen while I was in one of the workout rooms and was very disappointed when security told me they could check records to see who entered the workout room and took my iPod but it would be too much trouble to do so. Only one person entered the room while I was in it! 
Food is pretty expensive and the hotel room was pretty noisy. I was also disappointed by the cost of parking while they seemed to have ample parking space.Stayed here as a result of a Priceline deal. Got a good price but was surprised with $21.00 parking and $14.95 wifi. Lobby smelled like a musty basement. Not bad for an overnite stay but nothing to get excited about.The layout of the hotel is two-fold - one side is a retro- 6 wing (each 3 stories) complex. The layout is rather spider-like with the hotel's pool being the spider's body with 3 hotel wings on each side radiating out from the center like spider legs. The other portion of the hotel is a multi-story high rise. I did not see this portion of the hotel. The building, layout and design of the spider-like complex is somewhat old-fashioned and definitely retro. That being said, it is neat and clean. I had a king bed room on the second floor of the 4th wing. The room was neat and clean and allegedly smoke-free. However, to me, it smelled like someone had recently smoked in the room and no amount of cleaning had successfully eliminated the lingering smell. The room doors have a gap at the bottom that allows for a lot of noise to filter in from the halls. The cleaning staff began early the morning that I checked out and were EXTREMELY noisy. I was up already, but they were so noisy that they would have woken me otherwise. They were speaking in a foreign language and it sounded like they were shouting instructions at each other up and down the hallways. This went on for about 10 minutes before it stopped. Parking is an additional $19.95 per night for self-park and WIFI internet is an additional $12.95 per 24 hour period.Located within a couple of minutes of the airport this is a large hotel that we thought was great value. No problem with aircraft noise really nice bar and lounge with sensibly priced good food. RecommendedOur plane landed late at night and we stayed for one night at this hotel. The shuttle was easy to find at the airport and came by every 15 minutes. The hotel staff was very friendly and they give you each a wonderful cookie when you check in. The room was beautiful and plenty big for 4 of us. The best part was the balcony that we realized we had in the morning. The view was beautiful. We were able to take the shuttle back to the airport the next morning to get our rental car. The hotel was clean, beds comfortable, and I thought the rates were very reasonable. We paid $145 with all fees. I definitely would stay here again.I have stayed at this hotel no less than 10 times this summer and the hotel is comfortable but for what they charge here it is in serious need of an upgrade. The rooms are outdated, the hotel is outdated and it certainly is not worth the $200 a night room fee.This hotel has a charming feel, situated across the street from the airport. The wings of the hotel are decorated with exposed wooden beams and have good light over looking the pool area. Parking is expensive and you would think it would be included in the room rate...I hate that. Breakfast was nice and I found the hotel to be quiet.
We had room service in the evening for dessert and champagne and it was wonderful.Beautiful gardens, lovely pool area, well-equipped gym, restaurants, gift shop and a Starbucks coffee shop led us to believe we were at a resort hotel. We will definitely stay here again. The rooms were large with balconies, friendly staff as well as a shuttle to the airport -- We left wanting to stay longer. . We were leaving for Hawaii the next day and felt we had already arrived at our Polynesian Village with the beautiful ambiance of the hotel.Many of the Seattle Airport hotels have been there a long time and beginning to show their age a little. While this has been a long time choice, the hotel still feels fairly fresh and in good condition. Had zero complaints here and only paid around $130. Ate at the bar/restaurant. Choices and food were fine and not overpriced as is often the case in hotels. Room was a nice size and very comfortable and well-laid out. Internet is fine but they do ding you $15 per day. On a par with supposedly ""better"" (more expensive) places.We were stranded in Seattle overnight following a mechanical issue leaving London. After a string of disasters during the journey we finally ended up here, greeted by a friendly concierge with advise on times and flights for the morning, chocolate chip cookies for us at check in, and a room service menu to satisfy our hunger.
The rooms are huge and well equipped, everything was clean and fresh, and there were copious pillows on a very comfortable bed.
The property is sprawled and can be a maze, especially if you're jet-lagged. But once again the concierge was close by and came to our rescue when he saw us head in the wrong direction.
Although we never got a chance to see the hotel in daylight, the pool and grounds looked very well kept.The room was nice and clean.
Had requested 2 double rooms, but got 2 kings. The front desk was very accomidating, was wiling to give a rollaway, and comped parking for the inconvenance.
The only bad that we experianced was the wait person at the Seaport resturant on Friday night and the lady at the coffee bar on Sunday morning, could work on their customer services skills.
Food was ok.
Hot tub was nice : )Just a quick note to let travellers know that this hotel is everything you would expect after doing your research on this facility. The staff was wonderful , and the rooms and hotel atmosphere was just like it is depicted on their website and through the two major travel websites fantastic. It was a very relaxing stay with plush pillow top mattresses and very clean comfortable rooms. The hotel furnishings both in the rooms and throughout the hotel were top notch. Will definitely stay again.
Superb.We have stayed at the DoubleTree Seatac more than 15 times, love it. I suggest getting a room in the tower. Upgrade to King Corner Room or Penthouse to really treat yourself, balcony are amazing in these rooms. Service is outstanding, there nightclub is always fun and classy. Don't have to worry about drinking and driving, just a elevator ride to your room!The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and professional! We had room 717, which was beautifully updated and QUIET! We traveled with our two-year-old, and we appreciated the extra help with luggage, the crib, and getting milk for our little guy's sippers. We caught the 4 a.m. Shuttle to the airport, which worked perfectly. We even swam in the heated outdoor pool despite it being 50 degrees outside. We got a good deal on our park and stay package and plan to stay a second night on our way home. 
Cons: none! I usually do not rate hotels with five stars across the board, but in this case I have no choice. Our stay was perfect!I booked this hotel through Hotwire for a great rate, as I was only staying one night and wasn't really picky about the details of the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to have gotten the Doubletree! This hotel is by far one of the nicest (if not the nicest) airport hotel at Sea-Tac. The facility is a tower plus several small buildings surrounding a swimming pool and hot tub. One of the buildings backs onto a small lake, and there's almost a park-like atmosphere around the hotel. I arrived at a very very busy hotel, as the weather was bad and there were several flights either cancelled or delayed. Check-in was fast, and professional - and they give you warm chocolate chip cookies upon arrival! My room was spacious, very clean, and comfortable - especially after a treacherous drive down from Vancouver. My only complaint about the room was that the drain on my tub was VERY slow (to the point of being completely clogged), so I was showering in a puddle the entire time. The bed was fantastic. 
I went for dinner in the lounge/restaurant - that was extremely busy due to the weather cancellations - my server was very professional albeit personable and friendly! She made a great dinner suggestion for me, and as I was dining alone - I ended up sharing my table with a couple lovely Alaska Airlines flight attendants who were also ""stuck"" at the hotel. 
Check out was quick and easy, and I think they gave me more cookies! The shuttle driver to the airport was professional and courteous! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who is looking for nice accommodations either before or after a flight, or for anyone that needs to stay in the South Seattle area.I have stayed here on a few occasions the right before I fly out of SeaTac. They have great packages where you can park your car for a period of time while you are traveling. I have had good experiences with that package and feel my car is safe while I am gone. The rooms are very nice, quiet and comfortable. The staff is friendly. The shuttle to and from the airport is nice and runs every 20 minutes or so. I will stay here again and again.We stayed here twice in the last month. Booth times the service was very good, including the shuttle, front desk and the dining room. The rooms were very clean and quiet. The beds were very comfortable. I would and already have recommended this hotel. I will definitley be back.The room was spacious and comfortable, but the housekeeping staff was very loud in the morning outside and around our room. In addition, we received a telephone call 90 minutes before checkout time asking when we were checking out. There are many other hotel options around SeaTac, so we would likely not stay here again.Pros:
* very nicely decorated, close to airport, 24hr shuttle, 12pm checkout, comfy beds
Cons:
* no free breakfast, wired Internet, pricey if you didn't win it via pricelineThe hotel was conveniently located near the airport. They had a free airport shuttle, but you could actually walk to the hotel. I'm a Hilton Honors member and was told I was upgraded to a bigger room. I was disappointed to discover that my room overlooked the dumpsters. I couldn't get my a/c to turn on. The bed was comfortable, but the room was nothing special. usually when I get upgraded I stay in a suite, but this was nothing special. The hotel is huge. If you aren't in the main tower, plan to do a lot of walking. It was nice, but nothing to brag about. I laugh because when I checked in the lady said they wanted to be rated a 10 and that I should let them know if they could do anything to make my stay better. Trust me, they aren't a 10. They have a lot of work to do to meet that expectation. The chair is my room was frayed. Start by upgrading your decor. I don't want to see something that is obviously old and worn.I was laid over in Seattle due to Tropical Storm Irene and moved from the Comfort Inn to Double Tree for better accommodations. The hotel was supposedly full but a room was made available around 11:30 AM on Aug 28. I reserved two nights, since the earliest available flights left around 11:30 PM on Aug 29.
My room had a faint smoky odor that was irritating to me, so I requested a change within a few minutes, and was moved to another room which seemed better, though it had a strong deodorizer smell. When I came back a few hours later, the deodorizer had worn off and the smoky/musty smell was more apparent. But I decided it was not worth complaining again, since I would only be sleeping there one night. The hotel employee told me that sometimes people smoke outside and the smell gets into the room. But I find that hard to believe.
One reason I moved to this hotel was for the free internet terminals in the lobby, which I needed in order to rebook my flight. But, most of the time all four of them were busy - I don't think four terminals are sufficient for a hotel of this size. 
Eventually, I was able to find a free terminal after 11 PM and was able to rebook my flight for the next morning (Aug 29).
Aside from the air quality, the room was better than the Comfort Inn. I did not get a chance to try the breakfast.
When I checked out (at 5:45 AM on Aug 29), I was forced to pay a $50 early checkout fee. Had I known this, I would have only reserved one night at a time. I doubt my travel insurance will cover this fee. I feel like I got cheated, since this room would obviously have been vacant anyway. For this reason, I do not plan to stay at this hotel again.Good location for business in the city yet away. Was quiet and comfortable with nice clean rooms. Airport location was convenient.I was placed in this hotel by the airlines because of problems with the plane. This is a great hotel. Friendly staff. The room was very spacious and very clean. We had a balcony that overlooked the airport. With the door closed, we were unable to hear any airport noise. We will definitely stay at this hotel in our next trip to Seattle.Like many before us, we stayed here before heading out to somewhere else the next day. The check-in was a bit slow, but when our turn came, I could understood why because the desk staff was incredibly friendly and determined to answer all of our questions--she was a very nice person. In fact every staff member that we encountered here was friendly.
We had a double queen room in the tower, looking out towards the mountains. The room was quiet, very comfy beds and we enjoyed the view from the 10th floor; the room and hallways could use an update, but are perfectly adequate. The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional. I am told there are good Thai and BBQ restaurants within walking distance across the street. We tried the hotel restaurants and the food was quite good. Hotel pool is outside, heated to a nice temp and there is a hot tub nearby with a nice seating area all around. Self-parking is $19. Internet is free if you have HH Gold and works well. All in all a fine stay.I stayed here because it was close to the airport and is in the Hilton family. The bed was SO comfortable!!! The staff was very friendly and definitely went the extra mile. I think I lucked out with staying in the main tower, as this is a huge complex! I got lost trying to find the coin laundry. The laundry area is nice, though. The washers and dryers have timers on them, so that helps. Room service dinner was okay. Not great, but not bad. Love the cookies at check in! I would recommend returning your rental car and riding back to the hotel on the shuttle as parking is expensive.I have stayed here a few times before. Never had a problem, and obviously I returned. But when I tried to take a shower before I left for a meeting, the shower didn't work, no water!!!! Do not stay in 5120! Also, paying 21 bucks for parking while staying drives me nuts! And you can hear people in hallway.Like many travelers, we stayed here for one night because of an early flight the next day. Rooms are older and bathrooms are oldest:) Serious need of renovation. I didn't sleep well but I think it was nerves. Our room was quiet and the bedding very comfortable! The hotel is enormous. You will not get in and out quickly if that is important to you.
We were in Seattle for just two days, the first night way up north near Everett. We moved to the airport Doubletree so we could catch an early flight the next day. After learning of the $23ish valet parking charge, we returned our rental car the night of check-in and took the shuttle back to the hotel. Since the airport is across the street, it is easy enough to do this. Unfortunately we waited nearly a half hour for their shuttle which is supposed to run every 15 mins. Concerned, we left extra early the next day in case we had another long shuttle wait which sort of defeated the purpose of staying next to the airport! As it turned out, the shuttle was right there and we were checking in at Alaska Airlines (first shuttle stop) in 5 mins. 
We had dinner at the hotel. Average hotel restaurant food, service and pricing. Front desk service was friendly and efficient. We did not use any other hotel services. We were there about 10 hours total.
Bottom line: I wouldn't stay here as a base to tour/explore Seattle but it's fine for airport/stopover travel.Everything was fine until we looked in our bathroom. Large, modern, and yet not one inch of counter space? No place fo reven a tooth brush? Weird. Must have been damaged\removed is all I can think of.We really won the gamble with this hotel. We booked through a discount website and were completely satisfied with our stay. (For the discounted price) 
The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet. It even had a balcony! The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. On check in, the warm chocolate chip cookies were a lovely touch. All the staff we interacted with were great. I noticed many airline crews stayed at this hotel also. 
Our room was in the main tower, and was reached by an external elevator with glass walls. Getting to the room was a fun adventure in itself. We explored the other areas of this large hotel complex and noticed some rooms were actually are on a small lake, and others overlook the attractive outdoor pool. There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended. 
I can not say I slept well, but I think that was due to nerves and excitement about our pending vacation. I did find the beds comfortable, but very jiggly. Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water. I was also woken by the cries of a baby in a nearby room. The most disturbing noises came not from the jet planes across the street, but from the hallway. They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin. 
There is a Jack in the Box and Denny's across the street as well as a Subway, Thai restaurant and a BBQ restaurant nearby. The shuttle service to the airport ran frequently and was very convenient. 
If traveling with children, there is oodles of space to set up a portable crib. The hotel felt nice enough for a romantic getaway and was a nice treat as a stop-over. The room also had Wi-Fi access - we even had Wi-Fi on the pool deck! 
Overall, a great stay.We spent one night here before flying out to Alaska. They have a good stay/fly program that we always use to leave our car there while on vacation. The room was clean and bed comfortable. My only complaint is that they charge for the use of wifi in your room. I can walk down to the lobby and get free wifi or use their computers for no charge. So why would I pay to use it in the room??I reserved this room through an affiliate travel booking platform and got a great room rate. Aprox. 75.00 (not including taxes) for a full day stay. Late check in was effortless and was greeted with a warmed cookie. I think it is fair to mention it costs to use internet in your room but for business travlers I suppose that is an expected cost. Great friendly staff took the edge off our long day of intercontinental travel. I would choose this hotel again as our stop over.This is a large hotel. It is quite a walk from the lobby to the rooms (if this is an issue.) The staff was very friendly. The free shuttle is great. The room was nice and large but at $200+ a night, it could have used an update (especially the bath). Room was clean and linens were updated (duvets) and comfortable.First let me say that I'm a tough customer when it comes to hotels. I always have high expectations and can be difficult to please but I never have a problem when I stay here. Whenever I have an early flight at Seatac, this is my hotel of choice. The staff is very courteous, professional, and always willing to help. Recently they helped avoid a crisis when I brought the wrong Gameboy charger for my son by allowing me to take one from a big box of forgotten chargers -- for FREE! The rooms are quiet, spacious, and always incredibly clean. The pool is better than some 4 or 5 star hotels found in downtown Seattle. The food is also very good. It's only a few blocks from light rail so it makes it easy. I love this hotel and think it should be a model for other hotels to learn from.large hotel complex......I stayed in the tower and my room was spacious, loved the large LCD TV but didn't care for the funky carpeting that needs to be replaced.
Friendly staff, nice public areas and I like the 3 computers near the bar area that, in addition to the ones in the business office, you can use to access the internet. Buffet Breakfast is average, scrambled eggs not kept warm, choices pretty limited, and it still costs you $18. Parking is very expensive at around $20 a dayWe decided to stay here for three nights during our trip to Seattle. The checkin clerk was very friendly and said she would ensure we had a good view. We ended up on the 11th floor overlooking the airport and the Cascades. We had a balcony, the beds were super comfortable, room was a good size and clean. There are restaurants all around, plus two in the hotel. Shuttle to airport runs every 20 minutes. Great place and would definately stay again.Stayed here for the airport convenience but the free shuttle to the $3 rail line into Seattle was an added bonus. Really easy to get into downtown and great hotel price. Amazingly, I don't remember hearing planes or traffic and the hotel rooms and pool area were clean and great. Good food at the restaurant though a bit pricey. Front desk staff friendly & helpful!I have stayed at here many times over the last 10 years and love the feel of this hotel. The rooms are great and big enough. Would recommemd to anyone traveling in this area.My family and I recently stayed at the Doubletree Seatac overnight enroute to Chicago. We chose it for its proximity to the airport and for the week of parking we needed while vacationing in Illinois. 
Check-in and check-out were both seamless. The room was big, the beds comfortable. Our park and fly worked out to about $6 a night, and the vehicle was left not far from the entrance to the hotel. The shuttle service got us to the airport effortlessly (it runs every 15 minutes), though coming back we had to wait about 20 minutes. 
We'll stay at this hotel again, but will taxi back from the airport instead of waiting for the shuttle.I stayed one night at this hotel as it is very close to the airport. Overall the rooms were nice and clean, comfortable bed, and good location. 
Two issues:
This is a big property so it is a long walk to some of the rooms. Not a big deal but could be for others.
The issue I had is that my wake up call came 1.5 hours early.So I bought online and pre-paid for a discount (which you KNOW they see when you check in). I was travelling with an infant and a tween and we arrived at 11:30 a.m. (rental car was due by 1 p.m.). They were kind to let us check in early. We got a great room (2208) with a balcony, though the door was bolted shut. They are also a paid parking facility for Sea Tac so I had to drive through a ticket booth to get to another part of the lot. This is where the ONLY bad part occurred...Because I was the lone adult I had to make several trips to/from the car to pack up junk. Took me about 40 minutes. When I tried to get out of the lot and return the car, I was charged $4.00. I pressed the ""help"" button and after 10 times got a live person. ""Ma'am, parking is only free within 20 minutes."" She kept saying this over and over to me, with every question I asked. I was ""conversing"" with her for about 5 minutes when she said, "" I'll send a parking supervisor out to speak with you."" Forget it. I paid the $4 just to get the car back on time.
Now on to the rest of the good stuff...There is a shuttle to/from the airport every 20 minutes, 24 hours. The guy helped me with bags and though he didn't stick around waiting for a tip, I went back to tip him, especially since he helped me with my stuff at 0320 in the morning and even walked to the center of the crosswalk at the airport to make sure we got across safely.
The room was clean (the carpet, too). The only minor issue was one mirror that looked like a woman had sprayed hairspray all over it.
Room service is a bit pricey, but whose isn't? 
The pool was PHENOM! 3' to 8' and tons of chairs and tables. Even good pool sized towels (not the wash cloths that most hotels leave out). Also a jacuzzi, but we didn't use it.
There are several computers near the hotel bar that are open access and can print boarding passes.
Concierge on site, gift shop until 10 p.m. LOTS of tourists and groups there, so try to check in at least a bit early.
Jack in the box and Taco Bell within a block, 7-11 and gas stations/mini-marts, too. 
Check in staff friendly and accommodating. 
They do charge for parking and internet. FYI.Hotels are service industries. The mark of a hotel is how they treat their customers. Doubletree at SeaTac gets an F.
I can't issue a review on the actual rooms. The reason is that after paying for a room, the Doubletree didn't provide a room. No refund and no room.
I prepaid for a room.  Not just a reservation, but pre-payment.  According to the hotel's cancellation policy, the room was 100% non-refundable.  No changes allowed -- at least by me. Doubletree doesn't hold itself to the same standards.
When I arrived, however, the front desk said that they were full.  Which wasn't exactly correct, since during the time I was at the front desk, they checked in several airline-related employees. Evidently, the hotel was full for non-airline guests.  Also evidently, they double sold the room I paid for.  
They then shuttled my family down the street to another hotel.  After being dropped off, we were told by the replacement hotel that it didn't have a room to house my family.  Numerous calls to the Doubletree resulted in rude responses from the front desk -- when they bothered to answer and not leave me on infinite hold.  Finally, I called our booking company, who called the Doubletree's manager -- Robert.  He hung up on the booking company's representative.
Two hours later, the Doubletree shuttle showed up and dropped us off at another hotel.  But after repeated assurances that this wouldn't happen again, this other hotel also didn't have the room.
It was now 2 in the morning.  I finally arranged for my own hotel accommodations. 
As to the Doubletree, after taking my money, they did absolutely nothing to fix a problem they caused.  No refund.  No replacement room.  Not even an apology.  Instead management ignored the problem and hoped I would simply go away.  Their solution was to dump my family off at another hotel that didn't have the inventory to replace the room I had already paid for.
In 30 years of business travel, this is the worst treatment I have received from a hotel.This is a very large hotel, a bit dated ... but, it's very close to the airport, clean and not too expensive. They charge you a bit more for a room in the tower, but go for it since the tower is closer and the higher floors have a better view (even if it's only of the airport).
Chocolate chip cookies make Doubletree a favorite chain, but why do they (and other mid and high end hotels) feel the need to charge for internet service?? That's getting very annoying ... it's not worth $15 to $20 per night!! Stop it! Charging for parking is bad enough (but so close to the airport, that's understandable), but there's no excuse anymore to charge for internet.We've stayed at the Doubletree Seatac four or five times in the past few years, and we've always enjoyed our visits. The hotel has a convenient airport shuttle that picks up guests on level 3 of the airport parking garage at stops #1 and 3. The shuttle runs 24 hours per day, and it makes about three trips per hour (no phone call or reservation is needed). If you don't want to wait, a good alternative is the nearby taxi stand; fare to the Doubletree should be less than $10 because of the hotel's proximity to the airport. On a recent trip, we landed at Seatac after midnight and were picked up within five minutes. The check-in process was courteous and smooth, and we were given a nice corner room with a balcony on the 9th floor (accompanied by the delicious chocolate chip cookies). Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed watching airplanes takeoff and land, and this hotel provides an eagle's eye view of the airport (unless you're on the east side of the tower, in which case you're stuck looking at the snowcapped Cascades and/or Mt Rainier). Despite its proximity to the airport, the room was surprisingly quiet. At 1am the lobby bar was still very active with a jovial but well-behaved crowd, although the bartenders were understandably ready to head home to their families. I was able to purchase a reasonably priced bottle of Oregon pinot noir for in-room consumption. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed. My wife really liked the Crabtree & Evelyn ""Citron"" toiletries; I liked the very comfortable bed and blackout curtains.Unfortunately this property probably has seen better days. The rooms are large but the bathroom was outdated. It took forever to get warm water in the shower and the water pressure was extremely poor. There was no free internet in the room.Our family stayed at the Doubletree for one night before flying out to Miami for a Caribbean cruise. We parked our car there for a week, and were impressed with the service and rates compared with the airport. The rooms are a good size, which is a bonus for me as I was traveling with my husband and two large teenaged sons in one room. We spent a good portion of our early evening at the pool, which has an awesome setting. We had dinner in the attached restaurant, and the food was absolutely delicious. After a good nights sleep, the free shuttle to the airport saved us a lot of stress! We would definitely stay here again when flying out of Seattle!Stayed here with my 7 year old son overnight on our way to Asia. It was convenient and friendly. Clean rooms and love that they had room service. Prompt airport shuttle and amiable staff. Used the gym facility which was adequate and pleasantly unexpected in a hotel this size. 
Will be staying here again on our future sea tac layovers.First impression: crappy. Dingy. Old. Stuffy. Overpriced. If you consider changing a few light fixtures hanging some newer art and adding flat panel TVs a ""remodel"" then you'll be right at home here. Not only is it dark and musty smelling, but the staff really knows how to make you feel like you're an inconvenience. When I booked this room, nobody bothered to tell me they charge hotel guests $20/night for the privilege of parking in the same hotel you happen to be paying to stay at. When I attempted to complain to Marc (head of the front desk, by the way) he pointed out that parking this close to the airport is at a premium and I should be happy that as a guest, I get a discounted rate. Non-guests have to pay twice as much, he pointed out. Yeah, but they didn't pay $180 a night for a room to begin with, was my response. Besides, if someone is looking for airport parking, I'm pretty sure they can park at the airport itself for cheaper. Now who's the sucker? That's right, me. The one who paid in full in advance and had no recourse but to tell them about the negative review I was going to write. I could tell Marc cared deeply as he pretended not to hear. Here's the deal, if you want a nice place, go to Cedarhurst. If you want parking, go to the airport. Either way, move along people, there's nothing to see here...Faced with every hotel in downtown Seattle full I had little choice but to book the Doubletree at Seattle Tacoma Airport. It is a big hotel with several wings and if you get a room in the tower it saves a lot of walking. Packed with retired cruise ship passengers, it took time to be checked in. Reception staff though were polite but not that efficient. I was given the wrong vouchers for breakfast (included in the room rate I ourchased). This was quickly rectified by the waitress the next morning who obtained the right vouchers for me. 
One obvious deficiency is no bottles of drinking water in the room. You are supposed to go to the machine on your floor and pay USD1.75 for a bottle of water, and then the machine fails to deliver the bottle! Reception however retrieved the situation quickly and put two bottles of water in my room. Good service recovery.
The restaurant is far too small and at dinner I had to try and get a table at the bar. Food was quite good but service rather slow because of so many guests.
Room decor is drab and boring, but overall the hotel was functional and I did get a couple of nights decent sleep.We flew into SEA TAC for a few days before our cruise and our travel agent recommended this hotel. The hotel was clean, beds were fine, hotel is located across the street from the air port, was within walking distance to a Denny's, Jack in the Box, and a steak place. Room was ready very early in the morning for us. The kids liked the pool and I was able to do laundry before the cruise. It had easy access to the light rail located at the airport (we took the DT shuttle over), and was next to an Enterprise car rental. Lots of conveniences close by. Downtown Seattle was about a 30 minute ride by light rail service (cost of $16 for the 4 of us) or $40 cab ride to the pier. Hope this helps.We stayed at the Doubletree Hotel at the Seattle airport before and after a trip to NYC - the price was hefty compared to other options, but the Doubletree booking included 10 nights parking, which was exactly what we needed. I searched for other, cheaper hotels, but finally decided to keep my reservation. I am so glad I did. Their rooms are far nicer than other options in the area, and our car was taken away and brought back within minutes of our phone call to the front desk. Other than having to make a call to the front desk for extra cups and towels, we didn't need anything more. This is a great value when you are looking to stash your car and need to fly out early. At $240, it is actually cheaper than most of the other nicer options, if you add in all of the extra charges some hotels add on. I will try to remember not to price shop next time!We landed around midnight at the DoubleTree across from SEATAC and arrived to find a 100 travelers packing in the lobby that were going to take a group cruise the next day... Tired and longing to get to bed, we were thinking we would never get into our room... I asked a well dressed man who appeared to be the manager if they had another line for Diamond VIP Hilton Honors members? He walked around the desk and personally escorted me to someone who could help. We were treated very well, they apologized for the busy night, we weren't impatient, just tired, and appreciated the jesture...
We got our room, and it was just what we needed, comfortable beds, clean and quiet.
The staff made it work, they really did their best and we appreciated them!I booked a ""park and fly"" package through Expedia. When we dropped off our car at the Doubletree before flying north for an Alaska cruise, I went to the front desk and confirmed the room reservation for our return 10 days later. The day of our return to Seattle, I called from Anchorage to again confirm our reservation and advised the front desk that we would be arriving around midnight. Upon our arrival, I was advised that the hotel no longer had non-smoking rooms available and that we must stay in a smoking room. I explained that I was traveling with three kids and that a smoking room was unacceptable. The clerk advised that there were no other options. In fact, he did not even apologize for the situation.
I've traveled the world and spent hundreds of nights in hotels. This final night of a family vacation was my worst night ever in a major hotel.The hotel is just too big and impersonal. The rooms were clean and nice enough, but for what one pays there should be more. The front desk staff was professional but unfriendly. Parking is outrageously expensive — why can't hotels' business models stop trying to squeeze every last penny out of a guest? — so much so that I wound up parking across the street for half the price. The hotel charges for WiFi outside of the lobby, unless you figure out how to get around it, which I did, but I didn't like having to jump through hoops to do it. There were food trays and a cart on my floor for the entire day that we stayed there, and the floor's only ice machine was out of order the whole time as well. The only real plus to staying here is the hotel's proximity to the airport and the shuttle, but you can say that for other hotels along the same street. I'll be trying another one the next time I'm needing a room near the airport.I recently stayed here at the end of a journey from the UK that was in it's 26th hour by the time I arrived, staying only 1 night before travelling on to Canada the following day.
I used the airport shuttle which was convenient although I had to wait about half an hour, I think I'd probably just missed the previous one though. Check-in was very quick, I had my Expedia email with me so just handed it over and received my key and chocolate-chip cookie - yum ! 
The room itself was very comfortable, although - and prior to arrivng I couldn't quite believe the previous reviews that said they had got lost trying to find the room, how hard could it be ? - I DID get lost trying to find my room, this is a huge hotel so if you have mobility problems or just don't want to walk for 10 minutes to try and find your room then I'd specifically request a room nearer the reception.
As this was just an overnight stay in transit I didn't take advantage of any of the amenities but the pool looked very inviting and perhaps I'll be able to take advantage of it if I stay again. I'd recommend this hotel especially because of it's location to the airport.Will not be back.... there is not one benefit to staying at the Doubletree. They charge $21.00 per night for parking, there were dead bugs on the floor, so appearantly, they do not vaccum either. Housekeeping left the trash in my room upon cleaning it, there were trays of food left in the hallway from room service for two days and the coffee maker was broke. I was charged $2.00 for making a local phone call to the parking garage across the street. The only thing that is complimentary are warm stale horrible chocolate chip oatmeal cookies upon checking in. For the price of $129 a night, one would think something would be free, but nope. If you insist on staying here, park your car at the parking garage across the street, it's only $12.95 a day. This hotel is not for those who would rather spend thier money on sightseeing than on a room and parking.Arrived late, they had given our room away. Diamond members get a small gift...it was three pieces of fruit on a stick and two pieces of cheese...can you say cheesy!! Cookies were good, as always. Went to breakfast and got some french toast. Then there was this set-up for the syrup which was under a sterno can and full flame, the syrup was boiling. It was so liquified that it spilled all over my hand and burned me terribly. If it wasn't for Pam the waitress quick actions and bringing me ice, I am sure it would have blistered terribly. I am grateful she was quick. Keep your children away from these set ups, they are going to injure someone terribly!My two sisters and I loved this hotel. We stayed here for four nights before leaving on a cruise for Alaska and another three nights when we returned from the cruise. The accomodations were great. The room was big and comfortable for three people and the jacuzzi and pool were clean. The shuttle service from the hotel was great. We were able to get a shuttle to the cruise port, lite rail to go downtown Seattle and the the mall for shopping. We loved the fresh baked chocolate chip cookies, the gift store, and the entire staff at the hotel was very kind and helpful. Great choice for our stay in Seattle and we will be staying here again the next time we are in Seattle.We stayed here for a couple of nights at the start of our US vacation. We had a large room very clean and well furnished. Breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful. Hotel shuttle picked us up at the airport and took us to the light rail station to go into Seattle the next day. It wasn't noisy at all as you might expect being so close to the runways.I just returned from a trip to Seattle and stayed at the Doubletree Hotel at SeaTac Airport. This hotel is very very good. I arrived two hours late and they had my room right available and it even had a nice balcony and view of the airport. The room was massive in size and they had all the amenities one could want in a hotel. I highly recommend this hotel for its pool, beds, proximity to teh airport (you can walk) and restaurant.This is a large hotel located within one mile of SEA. The main building has two restaurants/bar/and a small store.
I stayed in the main building on the 12th floor and had a great view of Mount Renier and the surrounding area. My room was located in what I could call the back of the hotel, and there was no traffic/airport noise. My room also had a nice balcony.
The food and service at the bar was fine with a selection of local wines and beers. Only negative on the bar is it is very dark and you could not read a paper if you wanted to.
The shuttle service to the airport is very popular and was filled to capacity, so I would recommend arriving a few minutes before it departs to insure yourself a seat. The pick up at the airport was slower than I would have liked, but did finally arrive after about a 25 min wait.
This property has several out buildings and if you are housed in one of them you will have a short hike to get to the main building. Only negative is the elevators in the main building a pretty slow so it takes a few minutes to get up or down.
Near the bar they have three computer stations with a printer (very nice) which makes checking in on line very easy.
This is a full service hotel and overall I was very satisfied.After 2 weeks around the pacific northwest, we were lucky enough to spend our last night here. Finally, a spotlessly clean, spacious hotel! Next time, i would consider staying here and taking the light rail downtown, it was that much better than other hotels. Beautiful woodwork and large restaurant too. Free computers with Internet in the lobby.Excellent staff and very friendly. Rooms recently re-decorated..........housekeeping staff friendly ....pool area well maintained........great food.....desk staff very willing to give assistanceMy husband and I stayed here for one night before a cruise. This is a huge hotel. Clean rooms, comfortable bed. If you use their free airport shuttle service, make sure you get on the right shuttle from the airport because there is another Double Tree with a separate shuttle.i have stayed here several times when I have a morning flight. For $100 pre-pay I get a nice room, free shuttle to the airport every 20 minutes and secure parking for my car. The staff is always friendly and helpful - and the warm chocolate chip cookie is such a treat. Several computers (no waiting) ready for boarding pass printing, a Starbucks in the lobby and a restaurant/room service. A wonderful way to start any trip.We stayed in the tower at this hotel and found the accommodations satisfactory. We wanted to spend a day in Seattle prior to our cruise and we did not want to rent a car. This hotel provided a shuttle from the airport and to the Light Rail station, which was convenient. (about 25 minutes into the city) There is a wonderful place for breakfast, Dave's Diner, within a short walk of the hotel. 
The hotel suggested we take Seattle Express to the cruise port and for return to the airport. I am sorry to report that we were less than impressed with this company, in particular, on the return trip. We called them when we arrived and told them our disembarkation was at 9:35 a.m. After several calls, they finally arrived in a 10 passenger van at 10:45 a.m. There was not enough room for all the people who had made reservations. We were able to catch a taxi, for the same fare or even a bit less with the four of us. If you are on a tight schedule, I would NOT recommend Seattle Express.We had a nice stay at the Seatac Doubletree. Very friendly service, clean hotel and nice breakfast. The only downsides are that the hotel complex is huge, meaning long walks to the farther ""wings,"" and that the advertised free internet is only available in the lobby - internet in the rooms is expensive. 
Would definitely stay here again before an early flight out of Seatac.Made reservation through Expedia at 5:30 pm. Show up at 9 pm. Hotel desk staff tell me they do not have my reservation nor do they have any available rooms. Call Expedia. They fax something to Doubletree. Voila-a room becomes available. Fax-in this day and age? I'm not sure who to blame-the hotel or Expedia. The hotel tells me that Expedia needs to not only give me a booking confirmation number but a hotel confirmation number as well. Hello, that is not an option via internet booking. I don't normally book via non-hotel websites anymore as the deals are often just as good, if not better (free wifi for instance and a better room), than booking through other sites. I made an exception as Expedia showed an available room vs. the hotel which had no available rooms. Moving on...the rooms was clean but lots of hallway noise. It was also a bit of a walk with all of the luggage in the very early morning hours as we were in a building behind the primary hotel site. Due to the expense and the reservation complication, I would not return, There is also a nightly charge for parking.This was my second stay here in the last year. Decent value for Seattle. Checkin is quick, even if there's a crowd. Room service is decent, cleaning crew is fantastic. Bar is good, restaurants are average. 
Seems like they always have elevator issues.
Close to airport, close to I-5After reading the reviews of hotels near the Sea-Tec Airport I was loooking for the best out of what looked like a choice of disappointing hotels. We decided to gamble on this Doubletree. We stayed for three nights before sailing to Alaska out of Vancouver BC. The froint desk staff was great and the bellman was friendly and helpful. I had asked for a room near the lobby and extra pillows. Both were fulfilled. We arrived late morning and expected to check our bags until our room was ready with a 3 pm chek in time. We were shown to our room unpon our arrival (the hotel did not appear very busy). Their shuttle took us to the airport where we used the new light rail to go into town each day. I am glad I did not rent a car for our visit. 
We stayed one night following our two week crusie-tour to Alaska before flying home to Maryland. This say was fine as well. We only had one lunch and two coffee shop meals there which were very good.I never write reviews but I felt so violated after our recent experience that I had to warn others. We recently booked a room through Priceline at this hotel when we visited Seattle for a family graduation. Considering we paid $82 for our room, I was expecting a clean room with decent amenities. Imagine my surprise when I learned upon check-in that we would have to pay $21.09 to park our car overnight. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels, dozens of them near airports, and I have NEVER been charged to park my car unless it was some sort of park and fly package. Needless to say, I was not happy, but the room was prepaid through Priceline so I didn't really have much choice. THEN we got to our room and discovered there was no wi-fi available in our room, nor was there a refrigerator. Cherry on top? No free breakfast the next morning. I have paid A LOT less at other hotels and received way more for my money. I was extremely disappointed, and angry, and will NEVER stay at a Double Tree again. I will also be passing the story on to family and friends because that is just not right.We stayed here after a long plane trip. The room was perfect! Spotlessly clean, comfortable, great bath amenities, wonderful shower. We could not have asked for a better room!We chose this hotel because of proximity to the airport and were pleased by the 24 hour shuttle to the airport. Ths shuttle was on schedule and delivered us to the airport promptly at 4AM. The rooms were huge and had comfy beds. Desk staff and check-in/out was fast, friendly, and efficient.We found that most of Seattle was booked out for a baseball game, so looked a little further afield to SeaTac and found this to be a very nice & convenient hotel to stay.
It's massive! There were whole airlines staying here and using it for staff accommodation. They have whole wings of different suites that you actually drive to in order to access your local room & carpark.
Bed & bathroom was immaculate, clean & comfortable.
If passing through on roadtrip, or staying somewhere close after a long flight, I would recommend this place.This hotel is a very large complex - consisting of a 14 story tower and 7 interconnected, 4 story, wings. There are 850 rooms and 39000 square feet of meeting space.
We were in one of the outermost wings, and the walk from our room to the front lobby was quite long, not what you expect in a convenient airport hotel.
When we arrived, our toilet was clogged. I called the front desk to explain that we could not use the toilet, and they said they would send someone up. 30 minutes later I called back, waited for the front desk phone to ring for 5 minutes, and when they finally picked up they said they would look into it. About 20 minutes later someone finally came. 2 guys worked on it for the next 45 minutes, with this large ""plumbers snake"" to clear it. When they finally left my thought was I am sure the bathroom needs to be sanitized now. But I was surprised and disappointed to what I saw: brown water splashed all over the floor. I called the front desk, and our rooms were switched - at 10 PM now, about 2 hours after the initial call. 
Not to define my whole experience by this incident, but this hotel was just too big for what I hoped to be a ""simple"" stay, and it was clear this hotel did not have the management or staff to support this scale hotel.
There were lots of other smaller hotels in the area, that I would check into next time. (and they could use airport shuttle vans, not buses packed to the rim!)This was a real bargain through Priceline and perfect for our late-night arrival the night before our cruise. Right near the airport with a free shuttle and a great concierge. Only complaint was that the room was quite far from check-in, which was a bit annoying for us wearied travelers and a challenge for a handicapped guest we saw. Not really an issue though considering the incredible rate and excellent customer service. We even enjoyed our little balcony and the nice breakfast buffet in the morning, great coffee - yum!This fit the bill for the short time we we're using the room. Close to the airport, clean and quiet. It's not fancy or flashy or luxurious, but if you're looking for something convient for catching that early morning flight that isn't going to break your wallet or creep you out, this will be perfect. I could never get internet working, but we we're at room for so little time it didn't really matter.Very large complex with a high rise and lower buildings. Paid for the upgrade to asuite but somewhat disappointed. The bathroom was large but had no space for toilettries around the sink (the sink had no cabinet or counter around it).
Parking was expensive.We came here after a cruise package. We were all tired. The staff was very quick about getting all of us checked in. The rooms were wonderful. A huge bed, coffee and tea in the room. There was also a very big desk with wi fi hook up. They have a shuttle that will take you to not only the airport or light rail but also the mall or select places to eat. We would stay here again.I was put into this property by an airline due to a maintenance issue, although I checked in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, I saw enough that I want to return! The pool area, lobby and view from the balcony were very nice, not what I normally find when traveling and especially not this close to the airport!
From reading others reviews I was not in the main towers, and only complaint was only being on the second floor someone was above me and from the sound they made walking must have weighed 400 pounds as it was very loud.
Other than that, I was greeted very nicely and professionally at the desk by a staff member that had a very irate customer on the phone, in spite of him trying his best from the portion of the conversation I heard, he continued to handle himself in a professional manner, then when he place the caller on hold to assist me, was very courteous and professional. As others have mentioned as well, who's night is not made better when checking in and receiving a warm cookie?
The room was nice, comfortable beds, good selection of pillows, nice TV channel selections (was no guide so I had to search for channels). The two sinks were nice (one in the bath portion and one by the closet) that would be a nice feature if traveling with your spouse or children. Also nice view of some trees out the balcony. While the wing I was in appeared to be older, you could tell they try to take care of it and it was very clean.
Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor. I have also found that requesting rooms at the end of the hall are quieter.
I look forward to returning to this property with my wife and being able to spend more time in the city as well as what the doubletree has to offer!There is a 21$ overnight parking fee which we were not aware of when we parked. Our parking ticket was validated, but no one at the front desk told us there is a fee. I didn't know about the fee until I looked at my CC statement after I got back home.We needed a place to crash and dry out our camping gear while we went downtown for an evening soccer game at Qwest stadium. We took the Doubletree Hotel free shuttle to the Sound Transit station just down the road, and then took the light rail to the stadium. After the game we took the light rail back to the airport, and had to wait a little while for the Hotel Shuttle which we thought ran ""continuously"", but eventually made it back to a very comfy bed and spacious room. 
It was great that the bathroom had two sinks, one with the shower and toilet, and another across from the closet. Our balcony overlooked a lake, which was a nice surprise for an area in which most hotels overlook a parking lot. Our gear and tent dried out nicely out on the balcony.
Our final bill was slipped under our door before we woke up, so we just called the front desk from our room to confirm, then jumped in the car and were on our way.
We also got an amazing deal using Priceline.We also got this room for $50 on a bid from Priceline and we couldn't be happier! Everyone was super helpful and friendly. From the delicious and warm cookies each day to the extra coffee and cream we requested, a very pleasant stay. If only they could change the ugly weather in Seattle! Just kidding--the ""sunny"" hotel staff made up for that!We needed a hotel near the airport for just one night, and selected the Doubletree. It was a great decision. Our plane landed at noon, and when I called about an early check-in there was no problem. In spite of the fact that a large convention was concluding and check-out time was not until noon, they had our room ready and waiting.
The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and a large selection of various pillows. There was a good TV, and nice bathroom with thick towels and plenty of hot water. Every room seemed to have a balcony. Our balcony looked over the pool enhanced with mature Pacific Northwest landscape.
We loved the decor of the hotel. It was very suitable to the geography, and we did not have that feeling that we were just in any big hotel in any big city. 
We were especially impressed with the staff at the hotel. Our check-in and check-out were accomplished efficiently by pleasant and personable people.
You absolutely cannot beat a Doubletree chocolate chip cookie as a welcome treat.
My only complaint about this hotel was the charge for parking. I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car.
Nonetheless, we will certainly stay at this hotel when we return to Seattle again.Overall the hotel is quite good. The rooms have been updated but if you 
wind up in the 'low-rises' they feel oldish, and seem ti have a strange
woody smell. Be warned is a big hotel, and it could be quite a walk to your room.
 The cookie is indeed delicious, but the rates that they charge for parking
are just ridiculous, for one night over $21, that is just not right !I've never stayed at a Doubletree before, so I don't know if this is typical for the brand or not. However, my next visit to Seattle, I will definitely stay at this hotel again, without question. 
The room was excellent, clean and well appointed. The beds were insanely comfortable, with down comforters and pillows, a big flatscreen tv (although channels are limited), and very clean and comfortable. In room single-pod coffeemaker with Wolfgang Puck coffee - the utility of the coffeemaker was nice, but the coffee sucked. 
Elsewhere in the hotel, the landscaping is impressive and beautiful. The Seaports bar & lounge I cannot recommend highly enough. Michael and Bob, two of the bartenders, provided entertainment as well as quick service, well made drinks, and quickly delivered food. The salmon and clam chowder is a must eat if you are here - I've never had better. 
The Coffee Garden restaurant is a breakfast only location (except for conventions), and I recommend room service. This is the only bad part of my stay here - the staff was just shy of rude. They appeared to not care about making the guest feel welcome, and when they closed early one day for a convention lunch they simply told people ""we're closed"" with no explanation.
Seaports, Coffee Garden, Maxi's lounge and room service all come from the same line, and the chef is excellent. While I don't recommend the CG eatery, I do highly recommend the food prepared here. Of all the meals I ate in the hotel, none of the food was less than spectacular. 
The front desk was prompt with responses to anything I needed, quick on check-in. I will definitely stay here again.We got this room on priceline for $50.00. We were arriving at 12pm after a long flight so we needed a hotel room just for the night. It was a huge complex. The room itself was nice. Good bed and pillows. Quiet room. Good room service. My only complaint was the staff wasn't very friendly at the desk. There were about 25 people checking in at the same time and only 1 attendent. Also, this place is huge; we literally needed a map to get to the room. We felt like if we needed something we might not find our way back. Overall if you are needing a hotel for a night over after traveling this is a good hotel. Close to the airport. Not sure if I would have paid full price but for the deal we got it was great.Wonderful hotel. Very near to airport and very quiet nevertheless. Huge rooms. Double sink. Asked for and received extra towels and robes without hassle. Towels were large and fluffy. Housekeeping even called to make sure we received robes. Bright and airy lobby. Check in a breeze. Rooms were clean. Large screen TV with many HD choices. Toiletries were very nice. Lots of parking. Highly recommend this hotel.The service upon check-in was great. We were offered a fresh cookie, although due to nut allergies we had to decline. It would be nice for kids with allergies to have an alternative. Room was a good size and comfortable, but the hotel is huge so some rooms are quite far from the lobby. Restaurant food was good. Shuttle to airport was on time. Park n Fly was a decent price.Stayed here after New Year's day and following day since we had tix to Seahawks game 01/02/11. We LIKED the fact that it was close to new rapid transit terminal which we chose to take to stadium. This plus we luv their complimentary cookies that they offer upon check-in.
Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room. I had to trek all the way to the front-desk from out tower location (to have key re-coded) only to f ind it did not resolve issue. Frustrated - we called front desk - who called security - who called maintenance. They discovered faulty battery problem and reset. All of this resulted in out take-out food getting cold plus I lost my scarf somewhere along the way.
Also, wished to have their shuttle drop us off @ transit terminal but we were told to wait - we decided to walk and it was rather cold. Saw shuttle pass us along the way ;-(
Still, LIKE the location and the cookies ;-)Although we live in Washington, my husband and I along with another married couple, which are close friends of ours, stayed over Valentine's weekend (February 12th - 13th 2011.) We booked a package for the Valentine's Day which included dancing and champagne at the hotel's club.
Unfortunately, the weekend was unpleasantly interrupted the morning of February 13th when an employee of the hotel used his all access room key to enter our friend's room even though they had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door and check out time was much later. The Doubletree employee walked in on them in the middle of an intimate moment and saw my best friend naked. She was appalled and mortified and both she and her husband screamed and clumsily fell off of the bed in a panic. 
We roomed next door and heard the commotion, but thought it was just someone goofing on off in the hallway. We were appalled when shortly thereafter our friends told us what was going on.
When they called the management of the hotel (the highest ranking person in management on that day was the Housekeeping Supervisor), she reported that there were no male housekeepers, so they must be mistaken. Mistaken? Really?
The male friend of the couple is a Detective in the police department, and immediately kicked into ""detective mode."" He had to insist they contact hotel security and do an investigation to find out who entered their room.
Much chaos ensued along with my friend in tears and my husband and me trying to console her. I ended up speaking with the housekeeping supervisor, who added insult to injury by misstating my friend's first name to me and when I told her she was incorrect, instead of apologizing and asking for her name, had the audacity to tell me that my friend had misspoken her OWN name. 
Several hours later, we finally found out that the man, which indeed WAS on Doubletree's hotel staff was a ""runner."" He entered the room unauthorized to put water bottles in it (something that is only supposed to happen in unoccupied rooms being prepped for the next guests) and completely bypassing the Do Not Disturb, the fact that the guest list was registered to check out later that day, AND breaking many other hotel protocols.
This employee of Doubletree also did NOT report the incident to his supervisor. They had to investigate the room key access for that room to find out it had been him. 
There were other minor things that had occurred during the stay that one can chalk up to ""hotel anomalies."" As a frequent business traveler, I get that some minor things can happen. However, this security breach and the mishandling of the situation thereafter is absolutely inexcusable. 
I left a message for the Hotel's General Manager, which as of this morning has still to return my call. I will not be staying at this Hilton Hotels Doubletree property ever again. I suggest that if you want to feel safe, that you do not either.Despite the enormity of this hotel, it very much feels almost family run. The staff are exceptional and the quality without question. The hotel couldn't be better placed for flying out of Seattle.
I won't hesitate to book here should my future travels involve a long leg from Seattle.This was my first trip to Seattle and I arrived late in the evening, so really couldnt tell if the location was good or not. It was close to the airport which worked for me, since I was exhausted. The rooms were clean. Staff were friendly and quick to respond to requests. The rooms had a nice tv, but some of the furniture was a bit outdated. Very suitable for a business trip or budget conscience traveler. The cookies upon arrival are always a treatI would have to say the DoubleTree Seatle Airport is one of the enicest DoubleTrees I have ever stayed at. There is free airport shuttle service from the airport which I think is every 20 minutes and about 5 minute ride. The front desk employees are so nice and helpful. They great each person with a smile which is nice. I would have to say they treat Diamond guest better than some HIlton and Conrads hotels. The room are very spacious and clean.We've already stayed at this hotel three times in January 2011 alone. Living in Northwest Washington a drive of a couple of hours from SEA, we need a spot to park our car and a place to rest our heads prior to early departures or following late arrivals. The Doubletree fills the bill very nicely.
We have stayed at a variety of SEA properties including a couple of Hampton Inns, a Hilton Garden Inn, and the Hilton just up the street. As Hilton Diamonds, we find that the Doubletree is one property that offers us recognition in the form of dining certificates that are appreciated. 
They often offer a very competitive park-and-fly rate with valet parking that lowers the cost of the room to as low as $30-50, if you subtract what you'd pay at the cheapest airport parking lots, e.g. Shuttle Park 2, for the same period of time. They offer a 24-hour shuttle that runs every 20 minutes for much of the day. Because of the routing, it takes 7-8 minutes to drive to the airport, but only 5 minutes or so from the airport pickup point back to the hotel.
We're generally given an upper floor room in the tower, and find the rooms very comfortable. We connect our laptop in our room since Hilton Diamonds and Golds now receive free Internet as a perk worldwide. However, there are several free computers available outside the restaurant bar adjacent to the Starbucks stand, and free wireless as well in the lobby area.
Last but not least, we have eaten dinner there a number of times and have never been disappointed. Their head chef has apparently been with them for many years, and the menu offers a good variety of reasonably priced and attractively presented entrees. We genuinely look forward to eating there.
We're staying there again in a few nights and looking forward to it, despite facing a 6:00 a.m. flight the following morning. We're pleased to recommend this property as excellent choice for SEA.The Doubletree @ the Seattle Airport has been at its current location a very long time. Flying out of SeaTac, the hotel is easily recognizable from the window of the airplane because of its large campus and the tall height of its main tower.
The Friday night we stayed with at the Doubletree, we drove in from out of town, ate dinner and arrived kind of late, at least after 10pm. The front desk staff actually had a bit of a line to deal with as they were checking in an off-duty air crew and there was one other guest checking in. When we finally got to the counter we found the desk clerk to be very friendly in spite of the lateness of the evening. Just after completing the paperwork, we were offered the rather famous warm Doubletree cookies. They were quite enjoyable even if we didn't have any milk to go with them.
Our booking was through a low priced hotel source which does only double occupancy bookings, so we kind of assumed that we would get a single king room, however when we arrived at our room we found two queens. That is fine.
The room was very large, even for a double queen room. There was a great deal of floor space, so much so that even with a work desk and two occasional chairs the room felt a little bit like a cave. The room also had a balcony. The balcony overlooked the parking lot, however that side of the parking lot was controlled by the valet, so there wasn't nearly as much noise as you would expect.
The only issue we had was the cleanliness of the glasses in the room. We had to call the care line and ask them to send up clean glasses. Both glasses provided in the room looked as if they had food residue in the bottom of them. We received clean glasses about 5 minutes after we made our call.
My wife and I slept well. I usually don't enjoy hotel beds, they are either too soft or too hard, or in the worse case scenario, worn out; and to be honest I'm just used to my own bed, but this night I slept particularly well. If we had any neighbors around us, I would never have known it as there was absolutely no adjacent room noise.
We were very happy with this hotel and would happily stay here again any time.Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in.
Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost,
Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day),
warm cookies on check in.
We have stayed at this hotel several times, and others in the area. It may cost a little more to stay here, but we feel it is worth it for the quiet rooms and the very comfortable beds.This hotel boasts a ""Save 30%"" on Expedia.ca, but what is not obvious (and certainly unexpected) is that the rate is for only one person!! So you think you're getting a good deal, but they add on an extra person fee (at the checkout - it is not noted in the actual ""price"" - so right away, your 30% off is now less than 20% off!) Check your rates carefully - as what sounds like a deal is not!!! What is the point of advertising ""Deluxe 2 Queen"" rooms at 30% off, but I have to pay extra for because 2 people stay in the room? I have stayed at this hotel several other times - paying regular price - and it was always for double occupancy. This method of advertising is misleading. Having said that - I would still stay again - even if it is ""single occupancy"" rates, just more aware...This place has an exceptional staff - very kind and helpful. They need to be, because this is a tough hotel in terms of layout. It is enormous, and the signage isn't great for finding rooms. No wireless Internet in rooms (even for a fee), and many of the rooms have a funky odor. The place needs a serious upgrade. If you do have a room here, ask for one near the front desk (I think that would be in the towers) to save a hike. It's also easier to find your room in that section of the hotel.I stayed one night at this hotel, as we were flying out early the next morning. The hotel is conveniently located, just across the street from the airport entrance with a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes.
I was disappointed to learn there was a fee for parking ($16+tax), a fee for Internet ($5 for one hour), no simple breakfast included. 
When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that.
The hotel was nice; good clean rooms. Our room was connected to the main lobby by a skyway; we were in building 5 -- it wasn't very close. On the plus side, we got warm cookies upon check-in. The diner next door was good -- I think it's 'Dave's Diner'.
Overall, it was a nice hotel, if you are prepared to pay for it.I stayed here for one night (November 01, 2010) as this is our designated crew hotel for all layover crew stays while in Seattle. 
==> The Hotel in general: The hotel is located not far from the airport, just to the east of the airport itself. You can easily see it and will have some nice views of arriving and departing aircraft. They have a free 24/7 airport shuttle service. 
The hotel buildings and grounds itself are very large and the hotel complex is an unusual shape/design which tends to add to the privacy aspect. It’s comprised of one main large 11+ floor structure and six other shorter “wings”. The six smaller wings are laid out in a quasi-geometric design with their outdoor pool somewhat in the center.
==> Lobby / Check-in: We were picked up quickly at the hotel/car rental van pick-up areas and our bags loaded by a cheerful driver. We chatted along the way about our flight over and the local weather.. It was a :10 drive at best.. Upon arrival we got our bags back and walked into the lobby.. The first thing you’ll notice about the lobby is the nice fire place with sitting chairs and the like.. It has a very pleasing “Northwest” feel to it. 
As our rooms are pre-paid and pre-assigned, there is little front desk formality aside from room key distribution.
==> Room: My room was a basic mid-tier level in the main building and had a good view of the airport to the west. The rooms are well equipped, but not over-the-top. It was decorated in soft tones of golden yellows with some green and accented with natural woods.
The room had a half-sized work desk with multi-power plugs and good direct lighting. The TV was a newer flat screen TV with traditional programming. There is also a self-service stocked coffee/tea maker and the highlight of my stay-- THE COOKIES-- to which they are somewhat famous for!
Being close to the airport I was glad to see that the windows were reasonably well sound insulated. They were not totally sound proof, but even with aircraft landing nearby I could not say the sound was noticeable or distracting by any means. The drapes/window coverings aren’t totally black-out, so those who are extremely light sensitive sleepers may have some issues in the post-sunrise hours. 
The bed: It was a traditional US queen sized and more than ample for one. They had nice sheets and pillows (extra in my closet if needed) and an ample duvet as well.
==> Bathroom: My bathroom was average sized and equipped with most common fixtures. It had a combination tub/shower which I prefer as I like to take a leisurely soak from time to time. They provide most basic toiletries as well. 
Everything in my room and bathroom was in proper working order and was spotlessly clean as I would hope, and expect.
==> Hotel facilities and Amenities: The hotel has an outdoor seasonal pool which is located in the “middle” of the other smaller wings. Small, but more than ample for a dip or a leisure swim.. The hotel has a decent sized work out room and the best feature—an electronic indoor driving range! Naturally, being an airport hotel, they have all the classic airport-hotel features like free 24/7 airport shuttles, business center, newsstand, sundries store and the like.
There are two in-house restaurants; one that serves only breakfast in the morning and a second that opens in the early afternoon and serve both lunch and dinner. Neither serves on a 24 hour basis. You can also use room service, but this too is not a 24hour service.
==> SUMMARY: This hotel gets good reviews from my flying colleagues and I see why. Their staff are always pleasant and willing to do what you ask. The hotel is well maintained and has some ‘character’ to it- you “feel” like you’re in the Northwest. Rooms are of ample size and well appointed- nothing over the top, nor run down either. They have all the amenities, services and facilities that you’d expect from an airport-area hotel.
** PROS: Great location and easy access to/from the airport. Friendly staff. EXCELLENT cookies. There are some nearby alternate dining options that are very walkable.
** CONS: Limited in-house dining options. Room rates, prices for food/drink and parking options are little high (but in line with other hotel chains of the same class).Great customer service. There was a little problem while we were there, but the customer service was great. Very close to the airport. The parking was a little expensive ($16/day).This is an older hotel which has been modernized several times and is well maintained. It is an excellent location for business near the airport or an overnight layover at the airport for connections to flight, cruise, etc. It occasionally offers excellent value internet rates. It is about a block down from the main SEATAC terminal and can be walked in about 10 minutes, however, there is a shuttle service to the terminal. There are several decent restaurants within easy walking distance (remember it rains a lot here). One may also walk/shuttle over to the airport parking garage and catch the light rail directly into downtown Seattle, travel time about 25-30 minutes.
Hotel motif is NW Pacific rustic but it wears it well. As it is an older hotel the rooms are quite large and fully equipped. The rest of the hotel amenities are as advertised, think four star here. There are a number of other hotels in the immediate airport area but this one presents an excellent compromise between price and hotel condition.Wonderful large rooms with very comfortable beds, nice, clean bathrooms, all in a resort like setting near the city, shopping, restaurants, and sight-seeing. The hotel has great workout facilities, good restaurants both on-site and nearby, as well as wonderful room service. And it has great access to freeways that can easily get you to the best Seattle has to offer. This is a great place to stay.
I have stayed there 3 times in the past 4 years, the first time through Priceline. But even at styandard rates it is a good deal. I will only stay here when in the Seattle area.The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away)
The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc. No wireless in the rooms. Cheap toiletries, few towels.I booked a post-cruise package and the staff did not know how that worked. Hassle to get from ship to hotel, hassle to get correct rate, hassle with hotel safe (should have one in room anyway), and a hassle to get to the airport the next morning. They offer shuttle service (sporadically) and even though I was outside in plenty of time, at least 40 people showed up to try and get into a VAN. I took a taxi as everyone was trying to cram into the shuttle with no respect for first-come-first-served. Room service was good, however. Room was an ""upgrade"" but so far from the elevator. Would avoid this hotel in the future.Very conveniently located by the airport. Shuttle service is great, comes every 20 minutes. Staff is very friendly. Wide variety at the breakfast buffet. The layout of the hotel is very nice, not like you typical airport hotel. Beautiful landscaping. Hotel is close to the lightrail that goes all the way to downtown, so no rental car needed. Overall great experience.Each time I stay at this hotel I sleep hard. Not sure if it's the bed, the temperatures or the hike to my room- and yes, that's the only downside to this hotel. There are so many different wings and elevators to take that you might want to leave breadcrumbs on your way. This hotel is across the street from the Seattle Airport and there are several places to eat nearby. The hotel itself is nice and the rooms are quite clean. It has several fitness facilities that are very nice. Would recommend it if you're needing a place near the airport.This is a huge, full service property close to SeaTac airport. You get what you´d expect from a 3-star airport hotel: convenient parking, very confortable rooms, easy access to the terminals.
At first the property seems a bit old (carpets are not in the best conditions in the hallways), but rooms are impeccable.
Our rooms were very spacious and confortable, with great beds and big desks. Bathrooms were very convenient as well. We also had small balconies with a nice view of a lagoon at the back of the hotel. Everything is perfectly clean.
Wi fi is complimentary on common areas -it worked well, but the night I stayed here there was a blackout. Quite a creepy experience going back from one of the lobbies to my room, which seemed like one block away.
Staff is friendly. I would undoubtedly stay here again.This hotel is so close to the airport that you can walk it in about 25 mins if so inclined. Good news is, they've got a free airport shuttle, so no need to lug your luggage all by yourself. Quick and efficient check-in with friendly staff. Bonus treat: warm, gooey, chocolate chip cookies (1 per person). Hotel is very big. There's a center tower then several 3-storey ""legs"" that branch out from the lobby. We needed an accessible room for my grandma, so we we got adjacent rooms on the 3rd floor of the center tower. Piece of cake to find. Same guy that drove the shuttle also brought us (w/ our luggage) to our rooms. Very accommodating and made you feel welcome right away. Each room came with 2 queen sized beds, a TV, a table w/ chair & lots of clean towels. There's a pool that's mostly full of young families. It was a welcome refreshment after a long, hot day at a wedding. Didn't eat at the restaurant so can't comment. Had a rental car, and was very disappointed to find out that the daily parking rate was $17+. Unbelievable. Sure, it's what the other places charge, but guests should get free parking, or a break on the price. Especially since the hotel doesn't include breakfast. Rooms, bathrooms and common areas were very clean. Right around the corner from the lobby, there's a small cafe. In front of the cafe are 4 computers with free internet access. Useful since the hotel does not have free wi-fi in the rooms. Have to pay for internet access in the room per day, but it was too expensive. There were some people in the lobby with their laptops, so presumably, you can get free wi-fi in the lobby. Beds are clean and comfy, so I had very restful nights. Air conditioning was fantastic! A welcome relief during the hot August summer. Service was excellent and staff were swift to respond to requests. Our first day, we had lost the key to our suitcase lock, so had to call for maintenance to bring a pair of pliers. They were knocking at our door within 5 minutes of our call. On our 2nd last day, our key cards were demagnetized (from storing them with the cellphones & cameras in our purses). Was too tired to make it back down to the lobby so called for assistance. The cheerfully brought us new key cards within 10 minutes of our call (they had to program new ones). The first morning there, I was awakened early by the mass exodus of cruise ship passengers, but other than that, the hotel is pretty quiet. Lots of business and airline crews, so guests kept to themselves. Since we had a rental car, we didn't use public transit, so can't comment on that. However, this hotel is very accessible to and from the major freeways. This location is busy, so it felt safe even at nights. There's a Jack In The Box across the street and an IHOP less than a 5-minute drive down the main street. Despite the extra and exorbitant fees for parking & internet & breakfast, I liked this hotel because I can depend on cleanliness in the rooms, bathrooms, lobby & common areas and on friendly & accommodating staff. The only reason I'd consider another location for my next visit is if I got all that, PLUS free parking, wi-fi and breakfast.I expected more from a higher-end hotel. I have traveled extensively with my husband on business and leisure and this hotel was a disappointment. From the parking fee, to getting our name wrong the reservation, to parking under a tree (for a fee!) that wept all over my car, to the small details like charges for internet use (usually free in other hotels) and just two creamers for 3 cups of coffee... all added up to a one-time stay. We will not repeat the experience and will look for other accommodations for our all-too-precious time together.My husband and I were travelling to California, and decided to fly out of seattle. We parked our car at the double tree, much cheaper than the airport. We stayed one night on the way back, it is close to shopping (about a 5 minute drive), and the rooms were well appointed and spacious. We'd stay again.This Doubletree continues to surprise us! We have stayed at this location many times and have always had a fabulous experience. 
The stay started with warm chocolate chip cookies upon check-in and friendly front desk staff. Two tips upon check-in ~ ask for a robe for walking back and forth to the pool (much easier than walking around in a towel) and ask for a few more Moo's (if you're a coffee lover, there are only a few in the room). The staff will be happy to take care of these requests for you.
The rooms are not over the top but they are spacious and provide everything you need. 
The location is convenient to the airport, Mariners games, downtown Seattle, Southcenter shopping, etc. Everything is just 10-15 minutes away.
The parking is a little steep $16.95 but most of the hotels in that area surcharge for parking. At the Doubletree you can park in front of your room area if you are in the 3 story buildings. This is nicer than dragging luggage all over the conference centre.
The lobby has a nice restaurant, lounge/bar and coffee kiosk. The prices are reasonable and the drinks and food pretty good. The late night bar staff is a little odd but functional! The coffee kiosk ladies were super nice.
All in all I would recommend this hotel for business travellers, families and couples wanting a fabulous deal with great service.We stayed here after flying into SEA airport before our backpacking trip in Mt. Rainier NP. It was easy to find the free hotel shuttle bus from the airport. The first few buses were full of arriving passengers (we arrived on a Thursday evening, which is busy at any major airport, so I understand). The drivers were very friendly and apologetic when a few of us couldn't get on the first two shuttles, but they were proactive in using their radios to call other drivers to give them the heads-up. But, we got to the hotel just fine, and they gave us a voucher for food/drinks anywhere in the hotel that more than made up for having to wait a few extra minutes :).
We were given warm cookies at check-in, where the front desk agents were very nice and took no time to get us checked-in. I thought that they would be really backed up with all of the full shuttles dropping off passengers before us, but there were only two or three people in line when we walked up. We got upgraded to a nice balcony room on a high floor (we're HH Gold), but I can't comment on the view because we arrived after dark and it was foggy the next morning. Our room's balcony wrapped all the way around the side of the building but didn't have any chairs or tables. The room didn't have the newest decor, but the bed was very comfortable; the bathroom was nothing spectacular. I had specifically requested a room facing away from the airport tarmac and toward Mt. Rainier, so I don't know if noise would have been an issue had we stayed on the other side of the building. I don't recall any noise from neighboring rooms or jet engines the entire night.
We used our voucher to order breakfast delivered to our room, so I can't comment on the breakfast in the restaurant downstairs, but the room service was on time and food was good and hot. But the restaurant did have a Starbucks station in-house (that gets lots of points with an addict like me), and tons of comfortable seating w/ fireplaces that looked welcoming even if you weren't eating at the restaurant itself. There were some public computers near the entrance to the restaurant, which I used to print our car rental reservation, and another seating area with fireplace near the lobby entrance. The staff/valets were very friendly and helpful.We opted for the $5 requested upgrade for hhonours members, and the room was superb when we got it. At $65 plus the upgrade this was outstanding value, so much so we used it on our return journey too. Lovely spacious Doubletree, with gift shop and a very good restaurant inside it. Choice of food was excelent.I traveled to and from Seattle by Amtrak and used the light rail to and from the airport station and the Doubletree courtesy shuttle to and from the hotel. Check-in and check-out were efficient and I like the chocolate chip cookie when checking in (and every day if you ask for one). I spent two nights. My ground floor room was in a low-rise wing with a view into the parking lot (I kept the drapes closed). The room was large, very well appointed, comfortable and had an attractive decor. I was concerned about being beside the parking lot, noise-wise, but it was quiet. I had only one problem -- the TV remote did not work. I complained the next morning and when I returned there was a note under the remote that it had been repaired, but it still didn't work. I don't watch much TV, so it wasn't much of a problem. The price was excellent -- much cheaper than staying downtown in a hotel of comparable quality. I would return.Stayed here twice as part of cruise package. Notified them I was Hilton Honours member and asked for tower room on floor 7 or above as recommended by other reviewers. Received email saying this had been noted and they would try to accommodate. On arrival their system was down so we were allocated a room in a wing (think it was 5). Receptionist very polite and said if we returned in 2hrs when system was back up they would move us. Room they moved us to, however,was only on 5th floor wit view over car park. The cups (paper not china) were used and there was a used coffee bag in the machine. The bedside light was also faulty. We reported this on our way back into the hotel after going over the road to eat. The receptionist said he would send someone up straight away which I acknowledged was great as we had been up for over 20hrs and were very tired. 1.5hrs later no-one had been and I phoned down. I received an apology and another promise of immediate action. It took a further 40mins before someone appeared and they simply provided fresh cups. It was far too late to raise the issue of the lights.
Having said this the rooms were spotless, huge and the beds very comfortable with pillows to die for. Considering the hotel is opposite the airport it is not well soundproofed and you could hear the road and air traffic.
We didn't eat at the hotel but went to Dave's diner for tea-nothing special but cheap and varied, typical American comfort food- and Denny's for breakfast which was again, good value. Also didn't use the gym or outdoor swimming pool but that looked clean.
For convenience to the airport this hotel is fine (although it occupies a massive square footage and if you are allocated a room in one of the wings there could be a long walk) and there is a free, regular shuttle service to and from the airport itself. It is, however approx 20mins away from Seattle itself so not very convenient if you want to grab a quick sight seeing opportunity.
I think that in summary it does what it says on the tin and our hiccup ignored, it does it very well and comfortably. Check -in has been commented on previously and there does appear to be times when there are not enough staff to deal with the people trying to check in but they try their best and are polite and welcoming.Great Place to stay on trip to Seattle.........31/2 star Hotel (really nice) at rock bottom price on Priceline with shuttle service to airport, mall, and Light Rail to downtown Seattle ($5.00 r/t and or $2.50 r/t for seniors)............Very Friendly, very clean, but does charge for parking ($16+ a day) , so take the Light Rail (20 minuets to downtown. Came to Seattle with Red Sox Nation and found Seattle like Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco are easy walkable cities to enjoy with great public transportation............. Staying at the Doubletree at Seatac saved me more then $100 a day if i stayed in the Seattle Downtown area......Seattle Best Bet...............................Wait till next year ""Go Sox's""Stayed a night here, had a flight at the airport the next morning, no complaints, booked through priceline, would recommend. Only thing, I don't think they had wireless internet? I may be wrong.We stayed at the Double Tree for two nights in July. The suite was spacious, clean, and quiet. Our room had two sinks,a flat screen TV, and two comfortable beds. 
Very conveinient for early morning flights. The hotel shuttle will drop you off at your destination as long as it's enroute to the airport. Overall,it was a very pleasant stay at a very nice property. I am very delighted that we stayed there!!!!!!!!!We ended up at this hotel as our flight home was cancelled. We stayed near the airport at the beginning of our trip and stayed at the Cedarbrook Lodge as it was rated no 1 on Trip Advisor. This hotel is on a par in terms of service and room quality. Considering over a hundred people turned up at the same time due to the cancelled flight the check in was very quick. The staff went around the lines of people handing out the essentials of shaving foam, razors, toothpaste, toothbrushes and home made cookies as we didn't have our luggage which was checked into the cancelled flight. Room was enormous, with balcony and was spotlessly clean. Restaurant food was excellent and reasonably priced and breakfast was good. Shuttle service was very quick with plenty of buses on hand. The only issue we had was the size of the hotel with various wings that were difficult to navigate. A few more signs halfway down corridors would have helped. We got lost as did lots of people we met along the way! Don't let this put you off though.We live in the Seattle area, but it's a 45 minute drive to the airport, so we often stay at the Doubletree near the airport on the night before an early morning flight. They have a 24-hour shuttle bus to the airport that leaves every 20 minutes and they will let you leave your car in their lot (for a fee -- look for deals for Park 'n' Fly on their web site) while you are gone. It worked out to about half the parking rate of the major airport lots, plus you get a good night sleep and some extra time in the morning. Rooms are big and clean. Not much view even from the ""view"" rooms, but that's not the point at the airport. We always see lots of flight crew staying at the hotel, so I take that as a good sign. Little or no airport noise, but we sleep better soundly. Staff have always been friendly. And they have warm cookies on check-in. Last time we were there, our teenager asked on the way to the airport, ""Are we going to the cookie hotel again?"" That pretty much says it all!I ended up at this hotel due to an overbooked flight. I received a voucher from my airline and was taken to this hotel. The receptionist was aware of what has happened (I think they have a deal with several airlines who send their passengers there). I was given a double room at the very rear of the hotel. The hotel is huge, some of the rooms require a long walk up to them, up and the down the steps, lifts, long corridors, etc. The room was lovely with nice decorations. The outdoor swimming pool was very good. The hotel has its own airport shuttle. I am not sure whether it is free or not since I had mine covered by the airline. I will definitely look up the rates for this hotel next time I am in the Seattle area.We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied. The stay, park & fly packages are *usually* a good deal, and their airport shuttle service is fantastic - I believe it runs every 20 mins around the clock. Great for those early morning flights, and no worries about traffic jams as Seatac Airport is right across the street. Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out. The rooms are relatively spacious, our kids love the pool, and the breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get.Stayed here in August for one night, huge hotel but really freindly and homely feel to it. 
Extremely welcoming reception staff and very efficient too, fantastic hotel with great facilities, lovely pool, dining room, lounge area bedroom was massive and very well equipped etc etc etc.
The bar tender was brilliant, very freindly but not OTT was genuinely interested in where we were from and going, if i had my own bar i would have hired him.
 Food was to die for, (steak was HMMMM ) breakfast also unbelievable, would love to go back but doubt the chance will ever return .Very nice, clean, big rooms, convenient location. However parking costs $16/night.We stayed one night here before our flight home and I wish we had stayed here longer! What a great place. Warm cookies when you arrive. The parking situation was a bit weird - we had a rental we needed to return and we were given 20 free minutes to unload and get the car out, but the rental return was next door, whcih was nice. The rooms were gorgeous and spacious and comfortable. For $5 we got an upgrade to a family suite - which has 2 connecting rooms, 2 sinks AND a full bath. You cannot beat this for families. The pool was huge and gorgeous. This was cheaper than the hotel we stayed at downtown and I think in the future I would look for places like this outside the city and get a rental car to drive into the city.Clearly I overpaid for this hotel. I paid double the $69 rate other people mention. Plus you have to pay $16 to park your own car. First, the front desk sent us to the wrong room - to a room number that did not even exist. He said it out loud and he wrote it on the envelope that held our key. So we dragged three kids and a ton of luggage around looking for a room that did not exist. Had to call front desk to ask for correct room number. I had also requested extra blankets when we arrived. Over and hour later (and we arrived at 9 p.m.) they still hadn't arrived and I had to call the front desk again. The room was big and spacious and seemed fairly clean. There was some gum stuck on the side of the nightstand and one of the glasses in the bathroom was not clean. Then the best part - 11 p.m. the toilet overflowed and water went everywhere. They did let us move to a room down the hall when we requested a new room. Not on my list of places I'd stay again.This is a very large hotel and it's easy to get lost. As Hilton Honors members we had a room in the tower on the 10th floor. The room was looking a little worn but was reasonably clean. We had no issues with noise. There is a Denny's across the street if you choose not to eat in the hotel restaurant. The free shuttle to the airport left right on time.Booked on Priceline, got an ""upgrade"" to the tower with my Hilton Honours membership. Desk agent provided cookies and directions to the closest parking spot to the elevators for our room. The car stayed there for a few nights while we were away and picking it up was really easy with the fast pay machine. The shuttle was fast and the drivers nice. Everything was great here and 1000times better than the Hilton down the road that we stayed at the other day.We stayed at the Sea-Tac Doubletree for one night between our Canadian vacation and our flight home. This mega hotel served its purpose perfectly. We got a super deal on it ($45) through Priceline so I didn't expect to have the Penthouse suite. We had a room on the 1st floor in the 6th wing. We had a view of the parking lot but it was very, very quiet. Bring your walking shoes and map as this hotel is really spread out. 
Check in was quick. The desk clerk gave great directions to our room and handed us chocolate chip cookies as we finished. This hotel must be used by flight crews quite a bit as they had their own dedicated line for checking in. When we walked through the lobby, there seemed to be quite a line up except at that check in station. 
The room itself was nice - what I would expect from a Doubletree hotel - although it seemed a little dated. The bathroom in particular could use some updating as it had an ancient toilet and only a shower. We took a dip in the pool and the hot tub which were in a large courtyard between several wings. 
Since parking was $16 per night, we decided to return our rental car a day early. We were able to catch the shuttle to the hotel after about 20 minutes but we didn't realize we could have walked there in about 10. The shuttle was smooth for ride back to the airport the next morning. 
What really impressed me were the employees. Every single employee we encountered said hello. This seems like an amazing feat in such a huge hotel. Congratulations!We stayed here one night en route to a land tour in Alaska. Also stayed last year for one night. This is an excellent hotel. Very comfortable rooms after a long flight from UK. Free wi fi. 
We were given excellent help and assistance for our trip to the airport in the morning. The 'welcomer' arranged a special transport which was greatly appreciated. Best service anywhere yet .
Chocolate chip cookies are good too!I was here to attend a convention and the staff were excellent in all ways. From the cleaning staff to the front desk, every single staff person I saw, always had a friendly word or a smile. I was here 6 nights and I never had a nicer room. The beds were comfortable and the room spotless. There was a nice coffee shop and a breakfast bar that was set up each morning. A great place to stay.We stayed at the Doubletree on New Year's Eve because we had to catch a flight to Cancun early in the morning. We got an amazing rate on Priceline (total 53$). We used the shuttle to get to the airport terminal where we jumped on the train to head downtown to celebrate New Year's. We also used the shuttle again in the morning to get to the airport to catch our flight. The hotel offers were yummy cookies when checking in. It is a big hotel but very clean. Definitely one of the nicer airport hotels I have stayed at.Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot. To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to ""park and fly"", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!! What a rip-off!!We stayed one night here before our Alaskan cruise. I had gotten a great rate through hotels.com which included the breakfast buffet(which was $17 a person). The room was large and very nice. We stumbled upon a Princess cruiseline rep the next morning in the hotel who checked us in and took our bags, so all we had to do was get a shuttle to the ship! It made it very easy![Note to Priceline & other third-party guests] Like everyone else, 3rd-party customers read reviews and have expectations; exceptional attentiveness to guest needs is what distinguishes one 3 star from others. Third-party prices fill otherwise unsold rooms, and provide the hotel with opportunities to sell services and win future business. My advice to Priceline customers: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet and you bought from Priceline, tell Priceline in writing; use snail mail to the company’s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I’ve found them responsive. Talk to local management directly, pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational.] [If you are buying on Priceline an airport-area hotel of 3-stars, this will generally be what you get for $42-$55 depending on season.]
BE FOREWARNED: This is a giant airport hotel, poorly-mapped, with potentially-confusing room numbering and a condition of near-permanent chaos at the front desk. A person to interact with lobby arrivals when it’s busy (usually) would be a really good idea. Standing in any distant public area, you will likely see many confused and guests . . . trying to locate a room or service that may be a mile from the front desk. You are likely to stand for a long time at the long, long front desk, uncertain where to get help. [If you are disabled, help will be needed: sit down in the lobby, ask on the telephone for management or bell desk help to check in.] Dozens of room are blocked for airline personnel, who seem to check in quickly. Your room is as likely as not to be a mile or more from check-in. [Solution: Ask in advance for a room near the front desk. Ask for bell help with luggage. Ask for a property map.] 
COMMENDABLE: Continually running airport shuttle, will drop passengers at light rail station 06. miles north, pickup from that station on request or inside terminal during regular runs. Rail is a quick and cheap way of getting to downtown Seattle anytime 5 AM to 1 AM. Spacious rooms, good light-block via curtains. Excellent bedding, pillows, in-room coffeemaker; responsive wall temperature control. Free internet if you are an HHonors member, and becoming one is free. . . but bad download speeds. A mini-fridge will be provided on request, free if there is a medical reason for the request. Very attractive outdoor pool. Reasonably-priced soft drink vending machines ($1)--not typical of a hotel. If you can find it in Wing 5, a 2nd floor coin laundry with one washer and one dryer, $1 each. I always carry liquid detergent in my checked luggage, protected in a zip-lok bag. Free print of airline boarding pass in lobby, though not a customer-friendly kiosk or procedure.
CHALLENGING: Variable (common) but usually very slow wireless internet speeds: typical was 30 K/sec = hard to web surf or do serious work. Very expensive overnight parking, self-paid or valet; typical of airport area. Long building-to-building distances, very challenging for someone with a mobility handicap and luggage. The telephone system often is not answered from within guest rooms or from outside the hotel--it can ring 50-100 times or never answer. Bathroom in my room was distant from source of heat control; chilly tile. Beware of making a room charge in the “gift shop,” grossly overpriced snacks and sundries (not unusual for a hotel) operated by a vendor called “Travel Traders” and very reluctant to make a room charge--paperwork and a call verifying room is required, time-consuming because shop personnel can’t reach the hotel to verify. “Too bad for you” attitude. Vote with your feet.My mom and I took a trip to Victoria, BC and were only in Seattle one night on our way back home. We booked the Doubletree only because we got a fantastic price for our one night; otherwise this hotel is out of our price range. I wish we could have stayed here longer. The room, the service, the facility - all were wonderful. We happen to drive up at the exact moment a bride and groom arrived for their honeymoon stay, and that was a cute moment. We had a problem with a light switch and they helped us quickly and efficiently. The beds were comfy and beautifully made up. Food from room service was good and delivered quickly. Every staff member we interacted with was helpful, pleasant, and friendly.We arrived to the hotel July 23rd. late at night. I had called earlier in the day and was assured a roll-a-way was available for us. When we arrived we were told by the front desk the roll-a-way would be sent up immediately and would probably be there before we got up to the room. 90 minutes later we still did not have the bed. We had been told the bed would be sent at 12:00 midnight. At 1:00AM we were again told the bed would be sent right up. At 1:30 the manager on duty (Named Robert) introduced himself to my husband at the front desk. Robert immediately stepped in front of my husband and folded his arms and gave my husband many excuses why it was our fault we didn't have the bed yet. One excuse was that the hotel was full and they didn't have time to serve us as customers. I talked to the manager on the phone at 1:30AM and he was still full of excuses why we didn't have the bed. We were tired and against Trip Advisor's advice we went to the restaurant at the hotel for a late night snack. We ordered food and received ice cold food one hour later. The final straw was the morning we left. I noticed the statement was not under the door on the day we were leaving. When we did leave, there on the floor OUTSIDE our door was our statement with our name on it. Thank God our credit card number wasn't there.We spent 5 nights at this sprawling hotel adjacent to SEATAC Airport in Seattle. There were 600 at our convention. We were often crowded in narrow passage ways, where it was hard for other hotel guests to pass by. We had opted for an upgraded room with a view of Mt. Ranier, but our 3rd floor view was blocked by tall evergreens. A staff member informed us that we needed to be on the 9th floor & higher in order to see Mt. Ranier. She kindly took off the upgrade charges on our room. The food served at our final banquet was disappointingly cold and bland. There's nothing quite like gravy that is like jelly. There was free wi-fi near the lobby & pool. There were lots of folks staying there as a jumping off spot for their Princess Cruise to Alaska. The corridors near the pool were incredibly cold & uncomfortable to walk through. The front desk staff seemed sincere and caring while one of the hotel managers helping with our conference seemed to be more pompous than helpful.Appreciated the early checkin to my Miniature Convention held here. Was first told not possible on checking in on day of arrival for early time for room (phoned one week prior to let them know I would be travelling all night and arriving mid morning) but then they were able to accomodate me. Staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms clean and spacious. Hotel food was okay but not the best...but the morning brunch was delicious. Beds are very comfortable. Loved the shuttle service! Enjoyed 3 day stay there and would stay again!Across from Sea Tac Airport. Very big, spread out hotel with very reasonable rates and nice rooms, although some are a bit of a convoluted walk from reception. Lots of air crews use this hotel which has a frequent free shuttle to airport. We stay here and go to Seattle for Mariners games.
The shuttle will drop you at the airport train station if you are going to Seattle, but on your way back you must walk from the station to the shuttle bus pick up area at the airport(about a 5 to 10 minute walk). 
Parking and some extras relatively expensive.
We have stayed here a few times and keep coming back because it is good value for money.Our extended family took a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Alaska, starting several days early in Seattle so we could see some of the city. The Doubletree Inn across from the Seattle airport was part of our cruise package so to make it easy on our large group, we booked the extra days there, too. On the last evening there, July 4, we decided to wash a load of clothes to start the trip fresh. 
My husband hung out with the clothes from washer to dryer while I watched our son in the pool. As the clothes were finishing up with the 2nd round in the dryer (1st time barely got them dry), he popped over to the pool to tell me he was almost done so we could start getting ready for dinner. He returned shortly thereafter and I asked if he was done already but he replied that the clothes had been stolen!!! I thought he was kidding but he had a ""Property Loss/Damage Report"" form in hand to fill out. I felt sick trying to remember what we had lost - underwear, socks, favorite t-shirts, jeans, slacks, bra, blouses - basics we had for our trip. When and where could we shop to replace these things when we were flying out early the next morning?
The hotel uses key cards to get into the laundry room and there were no signs posted warning people to keep an eye on their belongings. At this upscale and very expensive hotel, we never would have imagined someone stealing our clothes. Husband submitted the report to a security officer who claimed that they would work on it and we'd be hearing from their insurance company. I wasn't satisfied with the response and went to talk with security myself and to get a copy of the report which they hadn't given us.
I got a copy of the report and a $50 voucher for their restaurant for our ""troubles"" with a promise that the insurance company would be contacting us. Luckily, Anchorage, our first stop on our trip, has a huge JC Penney's store where we were able to replace most of our stolen items, although some of the shirts were irreplaceable.
Fast forward 2 weeks and the end of our trip. We stayed in the motel across the street (no way would we go back to DoubleTree) and I went over to see where the case was. I explained the situation to a different security officer who at first said he knew about it but when I talked with him further didn't seem familiar with the case and tried to keep my copy of the report. He repeated that their insurance copy would be contacting us. We're home now and there has been no contact - no snail mail or voice mail from their insurance company. I don't know how long it will take or if we'll ever see any restitution but I want to warn everyone about the possibility of a thief lurking in the DoubleTree at SeaTac.
Oh, and the meal voucher was questioned by our waitress that night who took over an hour to get our food. We had reservations for 6pm, didn't get served until 7:15pm, the order was messed up, the food was cold, and the whole experience was terrible! They tried to charge us for 3 nights of parking even though we only rented a car for 1 night and told them so, and they added an extra ""pre-damage"" charge to my aunt's room before she checked out that she had to challenge when she saw it.We flew into Seattle for our cruise to Alaska. The hotel has 24/7 complimentary airport shuttle. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Doubletree. It was so comfortable, and the rooms are very large. We are hilton honors members so we were able to upgrade online to a family suite for just $9 more! Absolutely worth it. We took the hotel shuttle back to the airport and rode the Light Rail into town for sightseeing. The shuttle driver dropped us off at the rail station. The light rail is $5 round trip. We got off at the pioneer village exit and caught the Gray Line double decker tour bus around the city. It goes to all of the major sight- seeing venues. We took the Light Rail back to the airport and took the hotel shuttle back to the hotel. Only drawback was that we had to walk a little ways when we got back to the airport to get to the shuttle. If we went again we would have just walked to the hotel from the rail station. It was probably closer.
The food in the hotel is a little costly. We did eat there a few times, and the food was very good. There is a Denny's across the street and a Jack in the Box. We ate at both of them and the food was good there also. It is a major intersection but there is a crosswalk, and we did not have any problems. The hotel clerks were very, very helpful. There were a lot of airport personnel staying there. 
The hotel recommended Seattle Express to take us to and from the hotel to the pier for our cruise. I contacted them in advance and had a confirmation email for both trips. It was $12. per person each way. They also took some people to the airport from the pier. 
Everything was absolutely perfect. We had a great cruise and a great stay at the Doubletree. 
 Only negatives--
 no wi-fi in our room. We could pay for ethernet service but we did not want to do that. They did have Wi-FI in the lobby and there were numerous computers in the lobby that were available for use.
No complimentary breakfast - we ate once at the hotel. (good food). We went to Denny's across the street.
If you drive a car- there is a charge to parkI realize that this review can be taken as complete speculative, but I still felt it necessary to report. I am 100% certain the I left a wedding band on a TV stand in my room. Noticed it just after check-out. Multiple phones calls and emails later the same afternoon and through the following week (no returned calls or emails) - I had to be overly persistent. The ring ""could not be found"" - even though they checked the room before it was booked later that night. Again, I am certain where it was placed. The problem I have is that I spoke with multiple people who kept pushing me off to someone else and no one follows up even though they say the will. It's something that can be replaced very easily, but I question the integrity of the housekeeping staff if I have to stay here again.One free cookie per person when check in. No free internet for the room. There are 3 free public internet desktop computers. One break down but the speed is crawling and drive my patience nut . There are no free parking only 4 handicap parking spaces always filled .
$16 per night . The room is spacious and nice. I can walk to the airport easily for 10 to 15 minutes max completely safe with red light to cross the highway . The distance to walk to this hotel is not very much longer than to walk to the monorail station . It is really a good exercise if you don't have big suitcase to lug around . The employees working at the double tree are super nice . You can request new towel or other stuffs very friendly .
This hotel has a lot of ROOMS . They don't have enough customers, so they sell room rate at low cost but make up with parking fees, internet fees, no breakfast . However the bus transportation back and forth to the airport is very reliable . They do not hesitate to bring two or more bus in the early morning to take flyers to the airplanes.Good location. Right near airport. Had shuttles running constantly between airport and hotel. Staff is friendly, though they can be a bit rushed when lots of people are checking in. 
Beds are comfy. Room was large, but appears somewhat dated. 
Hotel is HUGE (800+ rooms)... so some rooms are fairly out of the way and a hike from the front desk. 
I was traveling with my sister and her family, so we got a family room. Very nice layout that I haven't seen elsewhere. Basically, 2 rooms connected with 1 bathroom. Had King in one bedroom and 2 queens in the other bedroom. Gave us all the space we needed.
No executive lounge here for HHonors members, but I am a Diamond member, so they sent a small fruit and cheese plate to my room. Nice touch. Also had $10 vouchers for breakfast at the restaurant or coffee stand (had breakfast sandwiches, yogurt, etc.) for diamond members.If money is no object then you should be satisfied with this hotel.
The check in staff seemed to be friendly until they realized I had booked with Priceline, then I was treated as a 2nd class customer.
The room wasn't cheap even through Priceline, then they charge extra for internet 15.00 usd which is pretty much necessary when you are traveling.
They charged another 17.00 usd for parking per day!!
Then I messed up I called a local number who put me on hold..... LOCAL CALLS ARE NOT FREE!
The staff is quite busy and hard to talk to at the front desk.
Now the good part is that the bed was the softest and the sheets were crisp and clean, there was a bit of airport noise all night which surprised me in such a high priced place.
The halls were noisy too, with people coming and going and doors closing.
There is NO BUSINESS CENTER and with no free internet.... very inconveinient indeed.
The rooms are built on pods and there are steps to the parking lot which are almost too steep, BE CAREFUL!!!
All-in-all, you better hang onto your wallet, they seem to be good at getting every penny they can out of you, I only stayed 1 night or they might have gotten more!!My friend and I are both Hilton Honors members. We are currently staying here and prepaid for the room. What they didn't tell us when booking on the website is that the parking is $16 per night and the internet in the rooms is not wireless. On the incoming leg earlier, we stayed across the street at the Hampton for about the same price, wireless internet, free parking and free breakfast. Just doesn't make sense. Overall, the room is nice, but could have a refrigerator in it for the price. One thing I have learned about traveling is that to bring your own router just in case there isn't wireless. Especially when more than one person in the room has a computer. If I come back to Seattle, I'd go back to Hampton.PROS: 
 hotel is very close (across street) from airport
shuttles run every 20 minutes and are larger busses - no getting squeezed out of the van
rooms were clean and well appointed
some decent food options just across the street as an alternative to the hotel restaurants (denny's/jack in box/taco bell/and a daves diner)
service personel were excellent - front desk/bellmen/housekeeping were all extremely nice and professional. My young son got sick and threw up all over the bathroom (at night) and someone was there almost immediately to help and did a great job cleaning up. IN the morning needed some extra coffee cups and lady picking up sheets took me to get some from a storage on the next hall - out of her way.
nice 24 hour fitness center.
use of computer stations in lobby
free boarding pass printing in lobby
CONS:
charged a fee for parking - even for guests, adn they had a large parking lot,. I can understand an inner city hotel with a garage or limited space, but not here
restaurants were a bit pricey, which is fine for the air crews who frequent the hotel with their expense accounts.
free wi-fi only in lobbyI stayed at the Doubletree for 2 nights, at a priceline price of $41 per night.
This was my second time staying at the hotel, so I knew what to expect, and everything was as expected.
I remembered from my last stay that (especially when booking through priceline?) there was a very long walk to the room. At check-in I was offered a handicapped room closer to the lobby, but after looking at the room, I decided that it wasn't really an appropriate room for a non-handicapped person (shower hose was about waist high, closet rails were also low).
So I was given a room in the wing farthest from the lobby. On my first walk to the room, I got lost, and ended up outside, then back inside, and walking up and down stairs several times. On later excursions back and forth, I figured out a more efficient route.
The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Good assortment of TV channels. Comfortable bed. Room service was available late, but the after 10PM options weren't very tasty. A nice touch is that the hotel has several exercise rooms, so there's one nearby when you want to work out. Nice equipment too.
The hotel is close to the airport, and the light rail system that runs to the city means that you can get into the city for less than $3.
The biggest negative is that they don't award Hilton Honors points if you're staying through priceline, even for things like room service.
I'd definitely stay there again, especially with the priceline rate.Location good, rooms good. However, when we tried to check in early the day before our flight home, we were told that there were only a limited number of family suites and none were available, even though they were checking other people in right and left. The girl took my cell phone number to call as soon as a room was ready but promply forgot me. I arrived at regular check in time and had to wait in line about 15 min. only to be told they only had 1 room on the bottom floor ready (we had requested an upper floor), she did comp our rental car parking fee as I complained it would only be on their lot a few hours as we were returning it that evening. My big complaint was that even though we paid more for a family suite, we were given the furthest room, in the furthest wing, as far away as possible from the main hotel. WE FELT LIKE VERY UNWANTED GUESTS, and it was very inconvenient to walk such a long way to reach the rest of the hotel facilities.At this hotel, there is a facade of fineness, however, once there, you realize that they cut corners during their renovation and to their staffing.
Pros:
1. close to airport
2. 24 hour shuttle service
3. pool
Cons:
1. They have renovated but, once you get in your room, you realize they cut corners. Carpets appear dirty, the marble sink countertop is broken and chipped, tiles in bathroom (some were updated but, others were chipped and dirty), sliding glass door could barely move and was old and balcony was at a weird angle.
2. They assured me that bell desk would help me in the am (I was traveling alone with 2 toddlers.) They said 'just call'. I called and let the phone ring for 30 minutes, then, gave up, loaded my kids and left my bags in room and went down to bell desk saying that i called and called and no one came down. This is a huge hotel and there are only 2 bell hops. They need more staff.
3. In addition, tried to reach front desk, no answer. Again, only 2 front desk clerks and huge line once I got down to talk to them. Doubletree needs to invest in staff. This hotel is big enough to have 4 restaurants.....they should add staff to keep people happy.Decided to stay one night by the airport and used priceline to get a room and ended up with the doubletree at a good rate! The hotel is pretty big but the location next to the airport is great. I asked for a room in the tower and the room was spacious with a nice king bed and a balcony that overlooked the airport. The views of the airplanes taking off was great! There are a few restaurants around the hotel area and you can also easily walk to the airport should you want to.Great hotel. Nice group of staff. Stay in the suite on the top and overlook the city from the huge balcony. Overall, it was a nice stay. The staff were wonderful, very kind and professional. The hotel is pretty big and can be a little challenging for new customers to find their way around the hotel to their room. Believe it or not, I kind of ended up getting lost and had to regroup at the front desk. The bell boy, with a smile, immediately said he'll lead me to my room - I was amazed of the great customer service! I was surprised of his great service. I thought, maybe, it was because it was just simply in his Asain blood - as I know of Asains to be very hard working and respectful. I noticed and received a very strong impression that the the entire staff were very kind and always said hello to passing customers. They have Starbucks inside the hotel on the first floor, so it worked out perfect for me!!! Again, overall, it was a great experience. Ask the concierieg about the Korean BBQ Restaurant in town - very delicious! He'll call a nice Lincoln Towncar for the same price for a cab. It'll cost you about $40 one-way, but it's worth it all. The mall is located only minutes away from the hotel, I think it's only 3-miles away...Had a great time...I'll be back!Before departing to New York, we stopped overnight in Seattle and stayed at this hotel after scoring a great deal from Priceline.
The hotel is huge and they give you warm cookies once you check-in. 
The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport. 
Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!). 
The only downside is that the lady at the front desk gave us the weirdest directions to get to our hotel room. We ended up going outside, and around and got lost when we found out later that we could have just gone around the corner from the check-in desk. 
We loved that they were playing the Canucks game in the restaurant/bar, too! 
The airport shuttle service was great, friendly and on-time. 
Staff is very courteous and friendly.Love that the hotel provided a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, every 15-20mins. The Hotel was clean, great staff, was greeted with hot fresh cookies at the check-in counter. My daughter, 5yrs old, loved it! My husband was hoping there was an indoor pool, but the pool was warm, and the hot tub was awesome. Pool hours was morning until 11pm. If you don't want to eat breakfast at the hotel, there is a Denny's across the street and an IHOP 2mile down the street. Buses are available for $2.00 and the Rail is $5.00 round trip to WestLake, Seattle, and back to the SeaTac. Love riding the Rail from SeaTac to downtown and the Monorial is $2.00 to the Space Needle.($4.00 roundtrip). I didn't rent a car, so didn't have the worries of paying a parking fee at the hotel. No need for a car, I got around just fine on the busses and the Rail. My room was very easy to find, but I know others had some difficulties finding their rooms. Maxi's, is a club to the top of the hotel. Heard it was great, but didn't check it out, as we had our daughter with us. Enjoyed they had computers available, and a printer so you can print out your boarding pass. Even though the hotel was close to the airport, you couldn't haer the planes taking off, it was quiet and very relaxing. Slept like a baby...very comfortable beds. Will stay there again in the future.My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree Hotel at the beginning of our Alaska Cruisetour. Princess Cruises booked this hotel for us as part of the package. My wife and I found that the hotel was clean and well appointed. The room was more than comfortable and spacious. The bed was really comfortable. We slept very well. There was a small problem with the toilet. The flapper needed to be replaced. We reported the problem to the staff on checkout. Did not bother us at all.
Would definitely stay at this hotel again.I was in Seattle on business this past week, and based on room price I decided to stay at the Doubletree at Seatac instead of where I usually stay, the Hampton Inn directly across the street. (The rate difference was a whopping $5.00). So to save $5/night, I ended up paying $16/night for parking (valet parking is $20/night), and $14.95/24 hours for internet. I received one $10 coupon for any meal, but even as a Hilton Diamond member, there was no coupon for breakfast each morning. The Doubletree is okay, the restaurant and bar are nice. But unless you have a room in the Tower building with a mountain view, (and you need to be on the 8th floor at least), there is absolutely nothing special about this hotel.
I will be back in Seattle next month and will galdly return to the newly remodeled Hampton Inn. The bed is wonderful, the working space is adequate, and the breakfast is complimentary for all. As for internet and parking, no extra charge.Very nice hotel, very close to the airport, walkable in fact to the terminals in less than 10 minutes or one can take a free shuttle bus.
Check-in was friendly and quick, and one receives a nice warm chocolate chip cookie along with the room key. Large spacious lobby, clean comfortable rooms. Flat screen TV with many stations available. Internet available in the room for a fee or free wifi in lobby. There are also complimentary computers to use also. There is a stand alone kiosk which one may use to check in for flights. All major airlines are represented. Can not speak to the dining aspect of the hotel as I did not eat there. All in all, a nice place to stay before or after the flight.I stayed here for several days to relax after a business trip. I got the hotel through Priceline, which ""upgraded"" me to here; I bid for a 2.5* and it considers this a 3*. I knew that the Doubletree was considered a 3* on Priceline and I did not bid at the 3* level because I knew I did not want to stay here. 
While I got a nice, quiet room near the end of a hallway, and the room was roomy and generally comfortable, getting to and from the room was a long haul indeed. And it took me a couple of trips to get the directions down right, as this hotel is somewhat convoluted.
The hotel offers no free parking and no free Internet access in the rooms. For both of these reasons, I cannot recommend this hotel as a place to stay. (Note, if you don't mind a short walk, go across the street that borders the south side of the hotel and up the hill (away from International Blvd.) slightly, you'll see a side road with no houses along one side. the parking is not restricted along this road, so it's a good place to park if you have a car.)
On more than one morning, I came downstairs to find the gift shop closed. I wanted to buy a newspaper. No one could help me. 
i asked if being a HHonors member would get any of the added fees waived, but apparently not with Priceline reservations. The hotel seems to be not content with having you as a guest; it will find any way it can to extract more money from you. The warm cookie upon check in doesn't even begin to balance the scales. Not recommended.This hotel is the BEST at SeaTac! Valet parking was very quick and hassle free. Check In went very smooth, and we were upgraded to a very large suite at that time! The pool is very relaxing and big. Lounge is great! The rooms are very spacious and very nice. Beds are SO comfortable and the best sleep I have gotten at a hotel. Shuttle service is very quick and so great! They leave every 20 minutes on the hour. I have stayed at many hotels at the airport, and this one beats them all!!! Especially with the shuttle service. You can guarantee that we will be back soon, no doubt about it.This was my second stay at this property, and when the price is around or below $150, it's worth the money. It's an older establishment that has definitely seen it's prime, but has rooms, that although are in need of an updating (like the rest of the hotel) are clean and predictable. Decent restaurant on site and decent workout facility with a Starbucks right in its Brady Bunch style lobby. When unable to stay downtown Seattle, this place is a good option (when the price is right).I was very impressed with the quality of service I received for my one night stay. My room was in the tower and was nice and quiet. I ordered room service breakfast which was excellent and right on time. Was provided a wake up call and a paper at my door in the morning. Also a warm cookie greeted me a check in as well as a friendly accommodating staff member. I was able to use a computer to do web check in for my early morning flight. Starbucks was waiting for me in the lobby as I left to take my free shuttle. I am a happy camper and will definitely stay again as travel thru Seattle quite often.I've stayed at this convenient hotel many times over the years and this time recommended 3 other colleagues book here as well for our business meeting. The staff are friendly and always available, except when the many flight crews arrive from the airport. This backs up especially later at night.
The breakfast is great - buffet or a la carte - something for everyone. The bar and snack bar are quite convenient as well.
The only downside to this trip was the 45 minutes for the shuttle to get from the airport to the hotel. I called the hotel twice and each time was assured a bus was on it's way. Only 1 of the 2 buses was running, hence the long waits and standing room only on the bus. Not a very good first impression for me and my colleagues.
Also be aware that the airport does operate some night flights and you may hear them if you face the airport across the street.
Hopefully, this will be remedied. Otherwise a nice hotel covneient for airport meetings.Stayed at this property for one night with my family ( wife and 4 and 7 yr old) before a morning flight. Used the park and fly package. Valet was quick and received help with bags. Check in was very quick and was assigned a two queen room in the tower. Room was typical for a double tree. Decent size with flat panel TV, and normal size bathroom. Had a room that faced away from the airport so that helped with the noise. Slept ok, but the room was quiet. Service was great and bell person got ice for us and was very helpful.
Check out was quick. Shuttle bus goes every 18 minutes and we walked out the front door just as one was leaving. Was hoping it would stop but it kept going (empty at that). At that point we waited the 18 minutes with 10 other people and caught the next bus.
Return to the hotel was fine. Bus driver called for our car but it wasn't ready when we arrived. waited a few more minutes for valet to bring car back. Be sure to have your receipt for parking from the front desk (i did thanks to previous posts) or you won't be able to get your car.
All in all a good airport property. Just be advised, this is a big conference service type hotel and they have many groups that use it....might not always be a quiet hotel, but for our trip it worked out great.Could not ask for anything better from this hotel. Good airport shuttle, room was clean and staff was friendly. Walking distance to a could of good restaurants. I was assigned a room close to the lobby and was able to pick up the free wifi. Good price on Hotwire.I have stayed twice at this hotel because it seems to have all the accomidations I want, a nightculb in the hotel, a pool, and the hotel is lovley. The first time we had a party. My credit card was charged twice, and the staff hounded me DURING THE PARTY when my cc company wouldn't take the second double charge (thank you B of A). My biggest complaint is the staff. They are not helpful, very ""I'm too busy to help you"" attitudes. I had a very difficult time nagivating my way to the room and no-one would take time to help me. When I went to the nightclub, the ASSISTANT MANAGER was so unfriendly and straight RUDE we even had an argument and I left. I will not go here again.
P.S. SUPER expensive parking with little validations availiableWe stayed one night and booked the park and fly 10 day pkg. The hotel valet parked our car and kept our keys while we were gone. When we returned someone had gone through our glove and jockey box and stole a few items. They also stole our garage door opener so they could have broken into our home too. Luckily that didn't happen. The hotel did not offer much assistance and tried to blame someone else. WE WILL NOT STAY HERE AGAIN!!!!We stayed here on a lay over home from Cancun. It was great to have a comfortable bed and room on our final night of holidays. The kids loved the pool which was warmer than the ones at the resort in Cancun which we could not believe as we were in Seattle! The staff was friendly and we appreciated the cookies after a long flight when we were waiting to check inn. Just a nice touch! Shuttle was convenient and would definitely stay here again.As prior reviewers state, great place to stay the night before a flight. Stayed with my teenage son. Wonderfully quiet, considering the airport is literally across the street. Rooms large and comfortable. But still charging for the internet!! (and no in room wireless). It may be a profit center, but when Best Western gives free internet, it is time to change the policy. Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste. I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night.We had the opportunity to stay here on the way home from vacation. It was a nice looking hotel, with clean, well furnished rooms. However, we arrived late and had to have maintenance in twice, once to fix the toilet the other to fix the modem. They followed up these services with calls to assure the maintenance was to our satisfaction which it was. The biggest bummer of the stay was when we attempted to get on the shuttle to get the airport, as we crossed the parking lot the shuttle driver told us we would have to wait until the next shuttle and basically left us in the dust.....I emailed the manager of this and received no response. It was funny that they bent over backwards to assure the maintenance issues were resolved, but when we actually had a concern they ignored us. However, we would probably stay again.The hotel is very expensive, but the room comfortable. My biggest complaint is the horrible quality of food. This hotel needs Chef Ramsey! I had the maple glazed salmon and I must say, expensive and tastless. The salmon was dry and overcooked and the presentation looked like it must have fell on the floor on the way to my table. We unfortunatly tried breakfast the next morning and I should have learned my lesson from the night before. The Chef must be on vacation or should be replaced!Stayed in March, 2010 for a one night lay over at SEATAC airport. Location proximity to airport can't be beat. Shuttle picks up opposite the terminal. Take the skybridge towards the parking garage and pick up the shuttle where all of the other hotel and parking lot buses pick up. There is a complimentary phone to call the hotel, but it is not necessary as the shuttle runs all the time. I have been told that the frequency depends on the time of day. I waited 15 minutes.
Shuttle was packed with airline crew members as this seems to be the place that many crews overnight. This made check-in painfully slow. Even though there is a dedicated check-in for airline crews, they are sharing the same number of check-in clerks so the regular check-in was reduced to one staff member. Eventually a second person came to help out, but when all was done I waited over 15 minutes to check in.
During the check-in process, cookies were received and I was asked if I was okay with a room that only had a shower in the bathroom. I said that this was fine.
Reviews are correct when they say that the layout of the hotel is confusing. I've never been lost in a hotel, but I found it difficult to find my room and had to back track once. Once I figured out the first number of the room is the building number, things made much more sense and the signage was adequate to find the room.
The room was smallish, and somewhat motel like in layout and finishes. The room, on the first floor overlooked a parking lot and another building in the background. The bathroom was a decent size and did indeed only have a shower. Again, the reviews stating that the bathroom floors are tile, unheated, and very cold are accurate. The floors in the bathroom were so cold I had to put down towels to create pathways. The shower, although a decent size, was disappointing and next time I'll be sure to ask for a tub.
The hotel is beautiful from the outside. Sort of ""west coast meets Polynesia"". The inside common areas are also quite beautiful, although still undergoing a rennovation in places including the front desk area. The rooms, although updated with new furniture, flat screen, bedding, etc., the overall layout and design of the rooms seem dated, including the door itself with a huge gap on the bottom.
Considering the price paid on Priceline.com, I would say that this hotel gave very good value for the price paid. I found the staff pleasant, but I really did not require their services so I can't comment on what other reviewers have said about the apathy of many of the staff.
The location can't be beat, and it is true that you could actually walk from the airport depending on terminal. I just could not figure out the sidewalk route I would take and one could tell from the layout of the airport that walking is just not encouraged, but it s doable.
There are many small fast food restaurants in the area, but fine dining appears to be limited. The landscaping of the hotel is beautiful, but I feel that all of Seattle is like this: lush.
I'll be back again by the end of the month and looking forward to my return visit.I stayed here previously and had a bad experience but the rooms were clean and quite so I tried it again. Still the same rude staff. I had this hotel booked for 2 days through hotwire and priceline but after the first rude encounter with the staff I decided to stay elsewhere the 2nd night, even though it was already paid for. I have always used travel sites when I travel and have never been treated as a second class citizen until I stayed at the super snobby Doubletree, The staff was not helpful at all my son left his wallet in the room when we checked out , he went back to ask about it and they gave him a cookie and dismissed him. May I add, they charge 16 dollars ( plus 1.52 in tax) to park your car. Internet is 12.95 or 14.95 as well, but they do give you a warm cookie when you check in ( ?) I went to another neighbor hotel the 2nd night and got free parking and free internet and the staff actually smiled at us, imagine that! Unless you are as rude and self absorbed as the staff here I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.I have been staying at this hotel for over fours and have stayed here over 60 nights during that time. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are very clean and tidy. If you can, ask if you can get a corner king room in the tower on the 4th floor or higher for a nice view of the Olympic Mountains. A major mall is only a 10 minute drive from the hotel with Nordstrom and Macys as two of its anchor stores.The only thing this hotel needs to offer is free wifi internet access. I will stay there again in the very near future and highly recommend itI stayed one night on business. This is an older hotel, but the maintenance appears to be very good. Only negative is the $15 charge for internet.An average hotel that could be so much better if the windows were better insulated for noise. We found the street noise to be bothersome, even with a high up room!Doubletree Suites looks like it may have been an Embassy Suites. Same layout anyway. Very nice and well worth the price.The Doubletree Seatac is my go-to SEA aiport hotel. I've probably stayed there 15 times. I've stayed at a handful of other hotels in the area and the Doubletree is probably the nicest and most consistent. I always book it via priceline. I bid $51 for seattle airport area, and 90% of the time I get the Doubletree. 
Location
It is literally a 3-min shuttle ride from the airport. Shuttles leave every 15 mins. 
Rooms 
All rooms are fairly spacious and consistent in their offering. I love the Neutrogena face and body amenities they provide, particularly the spf 45 sunscreen/face cream. Although you're in an airport town, some rooms actually have a lovely view of a little lake beside the hotel.
Service
I've never once had a bad experience at this hotel. My rooms have always been clean, front desk staff always nice, concierge always helpful.
Hints
- the cookies you get a check-in are good
- the coffee shop/lounge in the lobby has free wireless
- if you are coming home from a flight, staying at the doubletree that night and need to get your car from an external lot, wait to get your car until the next morning because the doubletree charges for parking nightly
- bring slippers, the tile floors in the bathrooms aren't heated and in winter they are COLD
- you can print your boarding pass in the lobby (unless you originally booked your US flight from Canada)
- the on-site restaurant is decent but in general I prefer to eat prior to arriving in the hotel area of seatac
- many airlines put up their flight crews at the DoubletreeWe left our car for 5 days and stayed in this Doubletree Hotel on our return,our shuttle arrived promptly and we were given a Tower Room . It was a huge room with great bedding,sheet count & pillows.
We were pretty late 9.54pm but managed to get a decent meal in the bar, I will happily come back to this doubletrees.
Only one hiccup when we were collecting our car through their valet ,the valet asked pretty abruptly as we $5 tipped him if we had settled our parking fee. Unfortunately I hope front desk could have better communication.Stayed here several times in the past on business, just spent a night on my own with a good Priceline rate. Incidentally, the local room taxes are about a 30% markup of the Priceline rate, but it's still a good deal for a 3 star hotel.
Rooms were clean, beds were very comfortable with nice pillows and linens. I didn't have any issues with noise, despite the fact I was in a ground floor room in one of the many sprawling ""wings"". TV is a good sized HD plat panel with Direct TV satellite service. Shuttle van was prompt and on time. Service was very friendly and courteous. 
My only complaint is the stiff charge for internet service ($12.95) for in room ethernet (no wireless in the rooms). The lobby has free internet and I camped out there for awhile with my laptop with some other rebellious types. The lobby is very cozy with a couple fireplaces, cozy couches and private areas, so it wasn't so bad. 
Like the hotel. Would stay here again.I landed at SeaTac Airport, called the hotel immediately and was told that the shuttlebus circulated every 15 minutes. As I was crossing the pedestrian bridge to the garage, I saw the shuttle standing by -- it didn't even stop or slow down. Despite repeated phone calls, it took another 52 minutes before the next shuttle showed up.
When the bus pulled to the hotel, I realize I could've simply walked faster, and I wish I had! It was like waiting for the cable guy to arrive -- they kept telling me the bus was on the way, right around the corner, etc., and either they were lying to me or the shuttle bus driver was lying to the front desk staff.
However, to their benefit, the front desk manager was extremely, extremely apologetic, upgraded me to a tower room and give me $15 coupon for breakfast. Also, you can't beat the price -- I only paid $40 on Priceline.
Despite the issues with the shuttle, I would definitely stay at this hotel again, but I would just walk from the airport... it's maybe a 10 minute walk at most.
PS the tower elevators are absolutely freezing!!I guess the deep down reason I liked this hotel was that I got a real deal for it on priceline. Aside from that, my room was excellent, clean, I enjoyed being able to work out before I left for my train the next morning. It's about a 3-minute shuttle ride from the airport (you could walk). The warm cookie they gift you at check-in is really nice and the bottled water waiting is a good touch too.This property is a mess. It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again. When you finally reach your room the heaters all make tremendous noise, rattle, rumble. I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room. I asked for a room in their Tower, but was told that Priceline customers had to pay a ten dollar a night premium, which I GLADLY paid. But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in. It's NO three star hotel at all. Priceline should be ASHAMED of rating it up with the Hilton SEATAC, where I was placed on the first night. The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare.Seattle airport is a little painful. It has unpredictable security lines, it's very crowded, and often the flights come and go very early or very late. So it's nice to stay real close, and I often do. 
I've stayed at the Hilton, the Radisson & the Hampton. They are all fine, but this Doubletree is the best. It is very large. The bar is unusually nice and the breakfast (my favorite: eggs benedict) was as I like it. 
Good internet, and very quick 24 hour airport shuttle. 
The rooms are definitely 3-star -- very clean and comfortable, just not luxurious.OUR overall stay was great, would have been nice to have no feathered pillows , not having a MICROWAVE,REFRIDG not cool, they charge each day for a roll away bed they said they would accomumdate for up to five in one room stayed three days so used blankets on the floor for the two boys I requested four blanket but had to go down to argue after only getting one they charge for wi-fi in room, LOBBY FREE- charge for daily parking no continuial breakfast without charging all these should change I called on phone for the entertainment book checking in nope they dont take it close to many places to eat,bank and even small cascino the airport close yes somewhat noisy but hey what one is not only during day time night time very quiet staff quiet friendly HOUSEKEEPING WONDERFUL yes i would recommend this hotel to others it'sa nice place is great for summer as with pool only on outsde .When you need a hotel near the Sea Tac Airport, stay at the Doubletree and ride their shuttle. The Drivers are very professional, courteous and make you feel like you are their only customer! If something might goes awry, the staff are quick to correct and aim to provide a memorable stay that makes you want to return. The quality of customer service should be an inservice for a number of their competitors. We have stayed at Hotels that are many times more expensive yet the staff are nowhere near as impressive as the Doubletree. The Wynn in Las Vegas should sign up for tutoring to learn how to treat customers. Perhaps then their vacancy rate would dwindle!We got a great priceline deal for a trip to visit family. Flights were late into the city and left early, so we wanted to stay near the airport. It's really close; the free shuttle ride is less than 5 minutes. Very comfortable, clean and the staff is nice. Avoid parking there; it's a hefty charge. If you're renting a car, it's just as easy to take the shuttle back to the airport car rental site.This was a great hotel. Close to the airport. They provided a shuttle if you do not have a car. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very nice. The swimming pool looked nice but we didn't get the chance to swim. We had dinner in the bar area. It was good and the staff was attentive. Check in and check out was easy and fast. It was a long ackward walk to our room. You go up stairs, down the elevator and thorugh doors. Odd but we made it. Surprisingly since this was close to the airport, we weren't woken up by any airplanes.Arrived late, room and facilities were great. So good, we are staying there again at an upcoming workshop in December.My grown granddaughter and I had just finished a 7 day Alaskan Cruise. Not pleased wit h a different hotel at the beginning of our journey, I sacrificed our prepaid, non-refundable reservations and opted for the DoubleTree Seattle Airport.
The accomadations were excellent, the service exemplary, the cookies upon sign-in fantastic, the grounds superb, the hottub and pool - flawless, room and all accoutrements flawless.The rest, quietness and friendliness of staff helped us relax and enjoy our short stay. All that and a senior discount - what more could anyone want.We stayed twice on our way to/from Alaska. The shuttle service was exceptional even though we arrived late in the evening. Food choices are limited but good. Several restaurants within walking distance. The rooms are spectacular. We stayed on the club level and had excellent views. My main concern at airport hotels is noise. There was NO airport noise at the Doubletree even though we could watch planes take off from our room. Overall, a great place to stay.A good value hotel near the airport and car rental though parking isn't cheap. Staff are helpful. And also they give away good cookies to hotel guests.Very close to Seatac, we were tempted to walk there from the airport. In fact, the free shuttle probably spends more time driving back to the hotel than it would probably take to just walk back across the street. 
The hotel is clearly old but Hilton has gone to some lengths to make it feel more up-to-date. It's obviously clean, although the further you get into the maze of halls the more the funky smell of ""old"" permeates the air. 
We utilized the free airport shuttle, which is handy, but did not use any other hotel service. 
The room was fairly quiet when other guests weren't talking in the hall. The bed was quite comfortable and free of bed bugs. 
The neighborhood has mostly fast-food or 'greasy-spoon' joints except for a nice looking Thai restaurant across the street. 
We would certainly use this hotel again as our layover sleeping arrangement on our way to and from vacations.I have stayed here several times and have enjoyed every visit.
This is a large spread out hotel that can have a confusing layout to first time visitors.
Pay attention to directions to your room, if you are not in the tower, and retrace your steps exactly as some floors do not connect through.
This hotel is used by several of the airlines for their flight crews on layovers

Cons-
Pay parking
Pay WifiThis is a large hotel and I expected it to be large and impersonal. On the contrary. It has ""small hotel"" service, meaning that you don't feel lost and they treat you well. Several fireplaces and seating areas in the lobby make it comfortable. I had a reservation for a ""mountain view"" room. Initially, I had a view of the airport. I asked for a different room and was given a much better view on the other side of the main section of the hotel. Very nice pool area although in cool, rainy Seattle I didn't get a chance to swim. The food was good although a bit pricey. The service in both the casual restaurant at breakfast and the dining room in the evening was efficient. Spacious room and very comfortable bedding. The room to which I was initially assigned had a broken lamp and a rip in the carpet. The second room was nicer. Looks like they are trying to keep up with on-going updating and maintenance. I stayed here four nights for a conference and was actually pleasantly surprised by the overall hotel experience. Lots of airline personnel stay here as well. And yes, we like the chocolate chip cookies at check-in.This is one of the most comfortable, beautiful properties I have ever stayed. The grounds are just exceptional, pool is beautiful, and the rooms are just 'heaven on earth"". 
.....and the chocolate chip cookie was warm and fresh....what a nice welcome!Airport hotel with shuttle service. Staff is friendly, lots of airline personnel staying at hotel. Conducted 2 day seminar at hotel. Banquet stff were friendly and helpful, meeting room was small for 35 people, breakfast and lunch buffets were good--not great. Staff checked in and were attentive.
Had truoble finding plug-in in my room that was near the bed--mvoved mattresses at headboard and there was very, very thick layer of dust on carpeting beneath headboard area. Room furnishings were older but in okay condition. Bathroom had adequate counter space but mold in shower corner. Flat screen TV but not Hi-Def. No make-up mirrors. BEST part of of room was nice fresh BEDDING and pillows.
Starbucks is served in lobby with some breakfast items--including hardboiled eggs! Dinner from grill with one beer, salad and appetizer with tip was $28 and not worth it--the craft beer was the best part of the meal.
Shuttle travels at regular intervals but often not enough--however getting a cab to take you to the airport is apparently difficult--hotel could not do this even with 4 hours lead time on request. Printing out boarding passes is quick and easy at lobby Kiosk.This hotel staff is very friendly and the location is extremely convenient to SeaTac airport; I even walked back and forth during my stay. The rooms are clean and most have a small balcony, which is nice. Flat screen TVs and a good cable variety makes staying in the room pretty easy.
The hotel offers reat Neutrogena soap, shampoo, conditioner, and sunscreen. Also, don't forget the free cookie when you check in! 
One thing to note - the halls are very noisy and the rooms could use some soundproofing around the doors. They all slam very loudly and you can actually see under the door from inside your room which allows a lot of sound to come in. I stuffed a towel in front of my door and that helped!I liked the rooms and I stayed in the 5th wing. Some of us had a view of Bow Lake. For the price of the rooms, I wish the hotel would include the internet and the parking, at least. One of our colleagues had to pay for a refridgerator. Overall, the atmosphere was nice and the staff friendly.Typical Double Tree Hotel. Comfortable, quiet, nice clean rooms. The restaurant wasn't bad and a decent value for the money. My one issue with this hotel was the onsite gift shop.
Charging someone $2.50 for a small bag of chips or 3.99 for popcorn that can be purchased for .99 at any convenience store is complete rip off and kind of ruins the the positive experience of staying at the hotel. I realize the gift shop is not part of the hotel, but not all guests realize that. Also, having some smart a$$ rude lady working there doesn't help matters either. My advice to the hotel, have these clowns get real with their prices or don't renew their lease. They really give an otherwise nice hotel a bad rap.Excellent for the airport, which is the primary box to tick - efficient service and a good, free, shuttle bus. Rooms were fine - nothing much else to say - apart from the selection of local food is very poor without a car - all cheap 'n' nasty chains - try the diner over the other side of the block, it's probably best. Also, internet access was not free, unlike many US hotels.Excellent hotel!! My friend stayed here the night before we flew out of Seattle. The proximity to the airport is excellent.
The rooms were very spacious, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was great with since and space outside for a second person to get ready in the morning.
The only negative was the hot tub. The hot tub was luke wam and the jets had a mind of their own and would turn on whenever they wanted.
Other then that the hotel was great. Beautiful area!This place is huge - felt like I was in Disneyworld!! This is an older hotel that has gone through a recent renovation. Overall I was quite pleased as we paid only $50 through Priceline.
Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area.It was the first time I've ever chosen Doulbe tree. It was well above my expectation. The room was quite comfortable. Free internet is offered in the area of Starbucks. The small outdoor swimming pool is not bad.When traveling in and out of Seattle for business I always stay at the Doubletree. It offers food, drinks, free internet access (in the common areas), and even has free computer terminals next to the bar. After a long day working it's nice to leasurely check emails while sipping a cocktail. I ususally rent a car from Enterprise which is just a couple of blocks from the hotel - they will pick you up and drop you off which saves paying the hotel's nightly parking fee.The rooms are so far-flung it was a big hassle. We got lost going to our room. On our departure morning, it took over 30 minutes and 3 phone calls for a bell hop to come help me with my bags. Normally I would have managed, but I was travelling alone with two young children and several suitcases and couldn't get to my car in one trip without the bell hop. Very nearly missed my flight because of the delay, fortunately the hotel was very close to the airport and shuttle service was adequate.Great location within view or shuttle ride from the airport. Princess has the contract for cruise passengers so you'll meet a lot of people coming and going on trips in the lobby or restaurant. Breakfast was delicious in the coffee shop, hot scones with jam and coffee. Other restaurants were withing walking distance of the hotel. There's a concierge desk which I found to be very helpful with questions. Free internet usage in the lobby too! I reserved off Priceline and got a great rate.I sateyed here with husband and 1 year old son. One night we arrieved to find out patio door left wide open. We were on the first floor. There were also 2 cigarette butts on the small patio. Nothing was missing from our room but we were gone for over 10 hours that day and I do not know how long the door was open. The manager comped our parking ($17/day) but he was supposed to let us know who the last person to open our room door was and they never told us. This hotel is by a small lake and at dusk there are misquitos and misc. other bugs every where. I would not recommend this hotel. The only good thing about it was that i booked it on Priceline and got a really good price.If you are staying near the airport, it is a great hotel. Easy to reach, very clean and well-appointed rooms. I was surprised at how nice the rooms were! The bed was amazingly comfortable. It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning. The coffee bar in the lobby was handy, too!Spent 3 nights at conference at the hotel.
The staff are wonderful! They are dedicated and helpful to your every need.
Bed's in the room were the heavenly beds and I slept very well all 3 nights.
Room was highly run down. Wall paper peeling off walls in different places, light bulb not replaced in room and carpet stained. Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted.
Food was very expensive in restaurant and just okay. Burger, soda and tip $21.00.
Save yourslf some money and eat off site.
This is a hotel in the Hilton chain and I was disappointed.....:(I bid on priceline and received a fantastic price for a room overlooking the lake. Great location to the airport and nice, short term stay in the room. My only complaint is the hair all over the bathroom, on the walls, tub, shower curtain, it was a real turn off to know the bathroom had only fresh linens and toiletries. The other issue was being charged $16.- + tax to park my car for the night. Yet there was a sign in the parking lot advertising airport parking for $13.95/ day. So they charge their overnight customers MORE to park there, that doesn't make sense to me.I have stayed at other DoubleTree Hotels in the eastern part of the US and have never had a bad stay. This hotel was a total disappointment. First thing . . .$16 a night to park!! Are you kidding me? Next was the lack of a microwave or refrigerator in the room. The worst hotel I've ever stayed in still had these amenities. The final straw was no free wireless internet in the rooms. Your choices were to either pay for access in your rooms or go to a ""common area"" where the wireless service was free. I was traveling on business so wireless internet service would have been a nice thing to have.
The room I stayed in was certainly not what I expected when we walked into the lobby. It was old and so-so on the cleanliness. Access to the room was also poor. You either had to walk a mile through the hotel to get to your room or drive around to the back parking lot at which time you had to haul all your luggage up a large flight of stairs. 
Overall I was not impressed at all with my stay. I have had better stays at Best Western and Holiday Inn Express. I would not recommend this hotel.This hotel is fine if you book on priceline. I got it for $65/night including taxes, but if I had paid full price I would've been bummed.
The shuttle bus takes quite a while in both directions. When I got to the hotel there were only two people at the desk and the airline folks checking in got first priority. Luckily, I was first in line, but if I hadn't been check-in would have taken a long time. My room was super far away, which I expected as a Priceline traveler, but since I only had a carryon it wasn't that big of a deal.
When I went to crawl into bed, there were black hairs in the sheets. Fortunately, there was another bed in my room which was hair-free. When I went to turn out the light there was a long blond hair hanging from the lamp. They could do a bit more cleaning to say the least.
Breakfast buffet was decent, and I don't like buffets. The service in the restaurant was great. Also on the plus side--this hotel is really quiet.
I was bummed to see that they let the shuttle bus idle for 20 minutes while passengers load. Definitely not a green nor a sustainable practice!
Book on priceline, but don't have high hopes. I'd stay there again for an overnight, but not for longer--two stars at most.Arrived about 10pm on Saturday 9-20-09. Nice place close to airport that provides a free shuttle. Went to check in desk and was surprised to find several people waiting to check in. Three people were working the counter, but about 9 couples were waiting to check in. I waited for my turn and was put off by hotel staff taking flight crew that arrived well after us ahead of everyone else waiting to check in. Situation got a little heated when a lady asked why they were being taken before her and a flight attendant stated (not very smart) they were tired from flying all day, had to fly out in the morning and didn't have time to waste in line. The lady answered they had been travelling all day from east coast and were tired, too. I lay responsibility for the exchange on the hotel not stepping in. The hotel does have a sign for a separate check in and should have taken them to that counter for the flight crews. I personally would rather wait a few minutes and have a rested flight crew to take me home. Also, I don't want to be involved in someone's argument at 10pm. 
Anyway, we checked in to a room (they give you each a hot chocolate chip cookie at check in) on the first floor of Building 5 which is a bit of a hike from check in. Put stuff in the room and went back to hotel bar. Ordered some food and drinks, watched sports highlights on big screens and went back to room. Decent food at good prices. The best was the clam chowder and Alaskan Amber Ale. Room was a comfortable king bed with a nice small patio. Room had coffee maker, big screen tv, desk and 2 chairs and a nice bathroom. Hotel has a big pool that has lots of sitting and is open late/early. Had a nice breakfast in front area called Coffee Garden. Very good food at good prices. I would recommend a stop here anytime.Wonder why the Doubletree (3*) hasn't been included (along with the Hilton) for the Sea-Tac Area Hotels. These are about the best of the bunch for hotel offerings near Sea-Tac. It's right across the street from the airport at 18740 International Blvd @ 188th...with free hotel shuttle to/from Sea-Tac. Express City Bus and others, stops at the corner to Dtwn Seattle for a couple of $. Used this hotel for pre/post cruise nights...and it worked fine. 
Great stay, great location....comfortable beds, yummy warm complimentary cookies. Parking is $16/night, which is a bummer.Got a room on priceline so it was a good deal. We were welcome by the front desk with warm cookies. It's a big hotel but needs some renovation including upgrading to double-paned or sound proof windows or glass doors cuz the plane noise can be pretty loud. Room looks ok except the broken chair arm-rest and no bulb for the desk lamp. We were pleasantly suprised to find the Neutrogena toiletries. Will stay here if we get the same deal next time we come back to Seattle.Scheduled a day in Seattle before our cruise with our flight arriving at 9:27 in the morning. The Doubletree airport shuttle picked us up and took us to the hotel. We weren't sure how our luggage would work out since check in time was 3 pm. The bell man took our luggage and our traveling companions and stored it until we finished sight seeing which was about 9 pm that night. We caught the MT194 which took us to Pioneer Square for $1.75 and same back to the hotel (an added convenience which is right in front of the hotel). The concierre arranged a van to take us to the Cruise Terminal cheaper than all of our exhaustive research turned up. We didn't want to pay the $5 for Wi-Fi for one night but they informed us that could pick it up for free in the lobby area which worked out nice. We checked emails while waiting for the rest of our party.Never had stayed at a doubletree, and I was very impressed with the hotel. First, this is a HUGE hotel. I believe I read it has something like 900 rooms. Makes it one of the larger hotels in the Seattle area. The cookies were nice, and I got a room in wing 5 which has a little view of a lake. I enjoyed having that. The pool area was really nice, it was 95 degrees outside, so an outdoor pool was PERFECT. I am told the pool is open year round too.
Overall I enjoyed it. Be aware it can be a very long walk to the lobby from your room if you get put in a wing, although I think the wings are nicer myself (they are a little newer).Hotel used as a layover for cruise ships. Nice rooms, ok food near by, can catch bus to down town seattle (30-45 min away) for 2-3$. I was expecting a dump as this was just a lay over between Denver and anchorage, however, the room was nice, VERY close to airport (you could walk). Corcierge was a tool. Restaruant was too expensive, walk across the street. Good price from the cruise on a package deal.Nothing but compliments for this hotel, rooms were immaculate,large and well kept. The commercial areas are a little dated but definitely acceptable.We ended up with this hotel by bidding on priceline. I was very satisfied with this hotel and thought it was much better quality than the Hilton. The beds were supersoft and the hotel very quiet. Would definitely stay here again.Most areas around US airports have lots of chain motels with little charm or uniqueness. This DoubleTree is almost a resort in its style, and yet right across from the airport. If you want a cut above when staying near Sea-Tac Airport, this is the place. Just be aware that (1) it's not cheap and (2) they charge extra for everything.
Our price was $176 per night grand total, about $100 more than nearby chains. The staff was polite and professional. The room was quiet, clean, and fully stocked. It featured full bath, air-conditioning, clock radio, phone, TV (about twenty channels), coffee maker, hair dryer, and in-room clothes iron. Free amenities included airport shuttle, boarding pass print-out kiosk (VERY useful if you have an early flight) wireless internet (barely) in the common areas, and a warm cookie at check-in. Parking is an extra $16, in-room internet an extra $5, and they charge for local calls. On-site was an outdoor pool, spa, restaurant, lounge, laundry room, and gift shop. You can have documents printed on-site via their internet access, but I doubt it's free.
The place is quite large, so you'll need a bell hop if you have a lot of luggage. In the morning they had to use the handy-man to perform this task, which doesn't sound right for a large place where people will need to get their luggage to the lobby in a hurry.
The staff tried to get me to pay extra for a ""balcony view"" room, but I can't imagine this is worth anything unless you get a view of Mount Rainier. Note that some ""views"" are of the airport, and Rainier isn't always visible -- neither of which sounds worth the extra cost.
The beds were luxurious and VERY comfy. My spouse and I slept VERY well after we finally decided to go to sleep.
You can spend a lot less near Sea-Tac and not get these annoying nickel-and-dime charges. But you won't get anything near as nice so close.We stayed at the Doubletree after getting a great deal on Priceline (that's why it was great value!) The pool was large and the perfect temperature. The hotel was very, very large. The only problem was that our group was split up into different buildings because the hotel was almost full. Overall, a great experience.The rooms are showing their age; but the location is great. We stayed in a corner tower room with a great view. Try to ask for one away from the elevators, or you'll find a few curious tourists looking in as they travel up the glass elevators.
We had to move twice due to problems with the room (t.v. not working and recently cleaned carpet still wet). The front desk staff were exceptional and quick to include a few extras to accomodate us for the inconvenience. 
The food in the downstairs lounge was very good and reasonably priced.
It is a very large hotel (850 rooms) so the pool was very busy; but it was still nice to have.
I can't say enough about the cookies they give you when you check in. They were delicious!We used Priceline and Doubletree was the hotel that accepted our $55 bid. I proceeded to TripAdvisor to find out what kind of reviews this hotel was getting, and I was so disappointed! I was not looking forward to staying in this hotel for 4 days/3 nights after reading all the bad news. 
Upon arrival, I said to the check-in hostess, ""I know we are Priceline customers, but could we get a little better room."" She suggested another $10 per night would get us a Tower Room (the newest of the rooms). My husband declined and so we just asked her to give us a room in which the television could be viewed from the bed. She did say that they have all types of rooms. I had read many reviews about the rooms in which the tv is located in an alcove and not viewable from the bed. I don't know why I asked this, but simply asking got us a WONDERFUL room!!!!!! I can not say enough GOOD things about our room, located in Wing 7, room #7206...very close to the lobby and parking.
The room was obviously renovated recently, VERY clean, VERY large, nice decor and new furniture, and also had a balcony overlooking a green area (instead of a parking lot). 
The room details we loved were: the large flat screen tv, the wonderful little coffee/tea maker and the ""to go"" cups/lids supplied, the full bathroom AND a second, separate sink outside of the main bathroom (Great for couples getting ready at the same time!), the newer, plush, and very large towels, the tasteful decor, the very comfortable bed with down comforter and pillows, wonderful desk area, ergonomic chair and separate seating area, and the DELICIOUS warm cookies upon check-in.
About the cookies: On the second night of our stay, we were craving some more of those delicious cookies, so we asked a worker walking by the front desk if she knew where we could purchase some in the hotel. She replied, ""There's some in a tin in the gift shop, but if you just ask the front desk, they'll probably give you some more...ah, there's a line there...I'll just go get you some."" Now, THAT'S customer service above and beyond the call of duty! :-)
About the staff: The check in was seamless and fast and friendly ""enough"", the maid service was QUICK, friendly, and provided us with MORE towels than we originally asked for (above and beyond the call of duty), the gift shop worker was very nice and funny, and the wondering worker who gave us extra cookies was great! Not one bad experience with the staff! Keep up the good work, Doubletree!
I can't say enough good things about our stay at the Doubletree and hope other Priceline bidders have as nice a stay as we did.
With all that said, I DO have issue with this hotel and hotels that charge their guests a parking fee (here it was $17 and change)...especially in a large area such as around the Seattle Airport. I can understand a parking charge in a city such as San Francisco where real estate is at a premium...but near SeaTac Airport??? That's like Albertson's Grocery Store charging you parking to come shop at their market. I just don't think it's good business. Nevertheless, I'd stay here again and just factor in the extra cost of parking...as long as I can get a great hotel rate.
Thanks Doubletree!!!I had a one-night layover flying in from Europe and out the next morning to Ca. This hotel is very convenient and comfortable, being located close to the airport and with large and comfortable rooms. The hotel is huge, with many wings, so if you have lots of luggage ask for a room close to the lobby as others have pointed out. Their free shuttle service is somewhat confusing and needs improvement. Follow the signs to ground transportation/airport shuttles. There are very many shuttles so you have to read the signs where to stand for Hilton/Doubletree. The first shuttle wouldn't let me on, said I had to make a reservation but when I called the hotel they said no rez necessary! The second one was 20 minutes later. I was extremely lucky to be the last person on, hence first off as there was only one receptionist and about 8 people were lined up behind me for check-in.
Room
I booked my room as a reward stay and it was a big king, w/balcony, desk, big tv, big bathroom with extra vanity area outside, nice Neutrogena products, air-conditioning (it occasionally warms up in Seattle). Bed comfort is very subjective; I found this bed comfy and firm enough. The room was clean, no complaints here. But: it was on the ground floor and I question the security at this hotel. I was right next to an exit and there are so many wings and so many exits I am sure people get in and out all the time. Not good. Keep your door and balcony bolted.
Restaurants
I had a very pleasant small evening meal (a cup of clam chowder, a delicious pecan and goat cheese salad and glass of wine) for a reasonable price. As other reviewers point out, there are plenty of options in the area. I also breakfasted at the hotel, a reasonable $12 for a continental buffet. The warm buffet costs more; you can also order from the menu. Most airport-hotel restaurants charge an arm & leg so thumbs up to Doubletree for these tasty, affordable options for dinner and breakfast.
Facilities. 
Free internet in public areas (wireless for a charge in the rooms), computers for printing boarding passes; gift shop; guest laundry coin-operated--a nice feature though there is nowhere to make change unless you purchase something (the front desk would't make change)! There is a nice outdoor pool area, I didn't try it but it looked to be a favorite spot for guests. I didn't try room service, though there were dirty dishes left in the halls (not good, Doubletree).
Check-out
I used the express check-out option and returned to the airport on the free shuttle (it is customary to tip the driver who will lift your luggage on and off); again, if you are using the shuttle you will need to be patient and also calculate plenty of time as they apparently run only every 20-30 minutes and are crowded. I didn't try the parking so no comment. I suppose you can also take a taxi; it's less than a mile to Seatac. Oh: I think you can catch a Seattle public bus right on the street for real cheap so that's definitely an option if you don't have piles of luggage. This public bus will also pick you up at the Terminal at arrivals. It is a super option if you are traveling to downtown, only about $2.00 (I have used it lots in the past), and I think it stops near this hotel too.
Conclusion:
If you can get a good rate this is absolutely a great place to stay for a layover if you don't have time to stay somewhere downtown and visit the beautiful city of Seattle (if you have a few hours take the public bus, stops near Pike Place Market etc).
p.s. I forgot the delicious warm cookie at check-in, everybody loves thatI stayed at this hotel as my flight arrived very late at night. I actually used Priceline and got it for a great price. I was thinking I would get a bad room, next to an elevator in the furthest wing from the front desk. We were on the 4th floor of the tower. The rooms were very roomy, comfortable queen beds, 2 sinks, very quiet. There is no WiFi in the room, but it is available down in the coffee shop/lounge area. We really were only there overnight so I can't comment on much else. However, I certainly would recommend the hotel to any one who wants a hotel that is close to the airport. They have a shuttle which runs continuously to the airport.Stayed for one night before catching a flight out of Sea-tac Airport. Booked thru hotwire and got such a great price ($69) we were worried what we'd be getting.... We were very pleasantly suprised!! We were greeted by very nice front desk staff and were given the Doubletree warm welcome cookies...what a nice touch! The room was very clean, cozy and very quiet even though it was so close to the airport. The hotel it's self was huge, but yet it still felt very comfortable. It has that ""west-coast"" feel to it with lots of wood and glimpses of green forrest outside. The beds were amazing. The restaurant was quite good considering it's not ""downtown"". The food was decent as was the wine selection. We will definately stay here again.I stayed here for one night before flying out of SEA early the next morning. This hotel is absolutely huge! As an Hhonors gold member I was given a corner room on the Hhonors floor with a nice wraparound balcony and also a $10 cert for the restaurant/bar. Unfortunately i only spent about 10 hours in the hotel so didn't really get to enjoy the room much. It did have a nice size flat screen TV and a very comfy bed, also a couch/seating area to watch TV from.
The airport shuttle is very convenient, they have a large school bus type shuttle to handle all the passengers they move to and from SEA. I think it leaves every 15 minutes all day long (24 hours).
Internet is a small fee to use in your room, but you can come down to the lobby and use it for free so that is what I did. Also they have a small gift shop in case you need to pick up any last minute souveniers, necessities, or postcards.
I used my $10 cert in the hotel bar for dinner and sampled a couple NW micro brews and had a very tasty sandwich. The meal was a bit on the pricey side, but the cert made it all work out for me.
I paid around $155 using a AAA rate which got me under the gov't per diem allowance for this business trip, however if I was traveling for vacation I would probably hunt for something cheaper.This is a really big Doubletree - the biggest in the world according to the Front Desk clerk. With 833 rooms, I don't doubt him!
It commonly comes up as the 3 star hotel for Sea-Tac on Priceline.
Big hotels usually have an assortment of room types, in my experience this one is no different. There are tower rooms and then rooms in many different sprawling two story wings. You could be in for a long walk if you are given a room in a far wing. 
I have stayed here over 6 times and all rooms seem OK. Some have been updated more than others, but always clean and comfortable. Our last room had a brand new flatscreen TV and an exremely comfortable new bed. The front desk staff will try to accommodate your room type request for a close by or tower room. Ask for a room facing away from the airport and International Boulevard. Watch out for 3rd floor tower rooms that are located above the ballrooms. Not so quiet if there is a live band playing right below.
Wired Internet (no in room wi-fi) was an astounding $12.95 per day. However free wi-fi is avalable in the public areas.
Shuttle bus service is excellent and runs from the hotel to the airport every 15 minutes. The drive is only about six minutes. 
You can walk to several stores and restaurants from the hotel. There are many good options close by including Sharp's and 13 Coins..
I will continue to stay here due to the great value when overnighting at Sea-Tac.I booked through Hotwire ($65) and was a bit concerned after reading the reviews. Check in was quick and impersonal. Two warm (and quite good) cookies were offered up.
I asked for and got a tower room. The room was large, very clean and well worn. Old fixtures -- one fell off in my hand. Very little airport noise or room to room noise. Heating unit was noticeable but not obtrusive.
Bar and restaurant:: OK food and friendly service.
This, however, is NOT a four star hotel. At very best, three stars. It is too tired and worn to be anything more. I would not pay rack rate for the room, but for what we paid, and for a one night stay, it was fine.I stayed here for one night with my girlfriend in August 2008 after arriving at Seattle Airport after a flight from London Heathrow. This was a great base after a long flight and was only a 5 min drive in the free hotel shuttle from the airport.
The hotel is massive and it must have taken us five minutes to walk from the reception to our hotel room! We had a large room with two double beds, desk, dressing table, large TV with a balcony overlooking the car park. 
Everything in the room and bathroom was clean and modern so inline with what we expected (and the warm cookie was a nice touch!)
If we flew to Seattle again, we would stay here for our first night again.I'm surprised at the negative reviews, I'm a regular Priceline customer, staying at the Doubletree usually once a month and have never had a bad experience. Granted it's a large hotel and I don't like hiking to a room in another zip code. I always ask for a room near the lobby and am always accomodated. The rooms in the wings are larger than those in the tower and if you get wings 2 or 3 closer than walking to the tower wing plus no elevator hassle. 
The rooms are always clean, the beds great, bedding and bath linens top notch. They recently have gone to flat sceen televisions throughout the place which was overdue but is greatly appreciated. I've always found staff friendly and every request granted. Airport pickup runs every 15 minutes. The cookies are a nice touch too. I'm always pleased when my Priceline bid results in the DoubletreeI have stayed here many times over the years so when I read all the reviews I thought ""it can't have gotten that bad"". In the end, I decided to Priceline because I was going on a short shopping trip, needed to stay out by the airport and I thought I'd go less expensive. I got the Doubletree. I would not purposely stay here again at this point. I was so negatively motivated by my experience I even filled out a comment card at the front desk which is unusual for me.
First of all what cookies? Once you are a priceline check in, you are dirt. No cookies. No room in the tower. Valet parking was ridiculous it took so long. Sometimes there was nobody there. Checking in I needed bellman assistance. I waited FOREVER and I do not exxagerate. They explained there is only 1 on duty and they get really busy so they would ""try"" to get one for me. The front desk service was inadequate, and several staff members were hard to understand. In the bar (which is being remodeled) the waitress was far less than courteous. They have 3 computers available for internet access. One was broken the whole time, another was broken most of the time, and they were VERY SLOW. And people sat on them all evening instead of minding the time limit. Nobody on staff noticed. I paid for an extra 1/2 day in order to check out at 6pm. But they didn't tell me I'd need to get my key reactivated so with my arms completely full and in a hurry to catch my flight, I go to access my room from the wing I was in (far far away from the front desk) only to be locked out requiring me to put everything back in the car, drive all the way to the front desk, stand in line while TWO people waited on one guy who wanted quarters, and then have to drive back to my wing. The rooms are marginally clean and there is an ""old hotel"" smell in the hallways. I left one day at about 8am and there was a room service tray outside the room next to me. It was still there at 9pm that night when I came back.
The beds are comfortable. The bathrooms are nice only in that they have a seperate vanity outside the actual bathroom. The nicest thing I can say right now is that this hotel USED to be nice.ok let me tell you about my experiance at the Doubletree Hotel. I stayed there for two nights in mid November and I will never go back. When I first arrived it was virtually a ghost town in the lobby. I had to wait close to 15 min. to be checked in. There was only one young lady helping a line of about 10 people. There was a bell desk and concierge desk, but nobody to be seen for the entire check in process, not to mention my entire stay. Now this is supposed to be a full service hotel? . I wanted to make dinner resv. somewhere nice but nobody was there to help. For how much I paid, 179 plus tax, plus parking, 20 for valet, I expect at least someone to recommend a nice rest. in the area. If you want a hotel that is very understaffed and expensive, 14 dollars for a couple of eggs, then this is your place. There are alot of hotels in the area and I would highly recommend not staying here.We stayed here for 1 night in August since we had an early flight the next morning. Check in was easy and the cookies were nice. Having the printer in the lobby to print your boarding pass was really convenient.
The elevators for the tower are not close. We wanted to carry our own luggage and got tired of the bell hops asking if they could take it for us. They were not too thrilled when we wanted to borrow their cart.
t was a very long walk to get to the room. The room itself was nice but not for $200.00 per night. The inner hall was quiet but there was a lot of traffic noise from the outside. The bed was comfortable but between the noise of the traffic ( not the jets) and the room fan, we did not sleep well.
There was mildew in the bathroom-cleanliness was fair.
The shuttle to the airport was very nice and had bottled water.
We would not stay here again because of the noise and mildew.I recently had a pleasant stay at the Doubletree Hotel in SeaTac, WA while visiting the Seattle area for the weekend. This was my first time in a Doubletree hotel and I was shocked when I was given 2 hot chocolate chip cookies upon check-in. The cookies were soft, warm and a nice touch after a long morning of traveling across the country. 
However, finding our room was a bit difficult. The hotel has two parts, a tower and a ""motel"" section that branches off. We were in the ""motel"" section and it was a bit confusing finding our room at first but I got the hang of things after a while. For those of you who don't like to walk long distances, you will be annoyed by the large size of this hotel. 
The hotel has plenty of ammenities but has a lack of an available business center with free internet. All WI-FI access is around the pool area and not available in the rooms - there isn't even a LAN line available for use in the rooms. I found this to be a bit of a setback. There are computers available for use near the coffee shop and the lobby, however those are almost always taken during peak hours. 
I had the breakfast buffet in the restaurant next to the lobby however I found it the food to be overall bland and boring. Typical ""hotel food"" - you'd be better off at the Jack in the Box across the street. However, do walk up international blvd to Sharp's Roasters - you wont regret it. 
The hotel is not too far from downtown Seattle, walking distance from SEA and not too far from the Tacoma area. Because of the proximity to SEA, various flight crews of various airlines bunk up here quite often between flights. Shuttle to the airport runs every 15 minutes or so and if you've rented a car, get a pass and be prepared to shell out $14-16/day for parking. However, if you have a car and are staying in the ""motel"" section, you will be able to park near your section and will be able to cut walking times drastically. 
Overall, I reccomend this hotel, specifically for a short stay. Gets the job done nicely. Have a nice stay.After I booked this hotel through Hotwire, I called them up & asked about parking, etc. They told me parking was $16 / day (are you kidding me?) and I told them that I was a teacher and attending a conference in the area. I was told that I would get a state employee discount for parking OR that I would get a discount because I was attending a conference.
When I arrived, I found the place to be nice and clean and impressively big. I told the lady (who was quite abrupt) at the front desk about what I had been told about parking. She ignored me and said, ""It's $16 per day. No exceptions."" I asked to speak with a manager and she said, ""He'll just say the same thing,"" and she did not get him. I again asked to see a manager and again she said, ""He'll just say the same thing,"" and she reluctantly went back and got him. It took a few minutes so obviously she was telling him about me . . . and when he came out, he (in the typical managerial type manner) apologized but refused to discount my parking, regardless of what I had been told. Even though he had the capability of discounting my parking, he wouldn't budge - regardless of the fact that I had been told that parking was discounted for state government employees and also discounted for people attending conferences. For that and that alone, I give this place a 2 out of 5 stars. Parking prices are ridiculous, and they don't keep their word. I should have gotten the name of the person who gave me the initial information. 
Additionally, as with other Hilton properties, there is no free wi-fi in the rooms. Not only are the rooms very expensive, but you have to pay for the convenience of having internet access in your room. I can stay in much cheaper locations (the Marriot, La Quinta, even roadside inns on the coast) and they always provide free wi-fi in the rooms. What a rip-off! They do have free wi-fi if you make the long trek to the lobby, but this is a large hotel so it's extremely inconvenient.
The TV was old and small. Much cheaper hotels are offering flat-screen TV's with HD channels . . . so an old dumpy TV seems a bit out of place.
So, lousy service, expensive parking, old TVs, dishonest employees . . . I give this hotel a big thumbs-down. 
I will say that the room was nice, the pillows were big and fluffy, the property was clean and very well secured.My husband and I stayed here for one night prior to our Alaskan cruise. Although we arrived after midnight, the free shuttle was there to pick us up within a few minutes. Check in was smooth, and the warm cookies were a very nice touch.
The room was clean, spacious, and very comfortable. We had booked a package that included the room + shuttle to the pier. I was contacted by the hotel a couple of weeks before our trip to reconfirm our reservation, and to find out what ship we were sailing on so they could schedule the shuttle to fit our needs.
The shuttle got us to the ship in plenty of time, and with no hassles at all.
Overall, I would highly recommend the Seattle Airport Doubletree if you are arriving before a cruise. Very friendly staff, and lovely rooms.I stayed at this hotel with my husband who had a conference here. We stayed in the main building/tower which I strongly recommend. The room was clean and comfortable with a balcony which faced the rear, with a view of trees and a small house with many cats! It was quiet, no doors slamming or sounds from adjacent rooms. There is a restaurant, coffee stand and bar downstairs. I did not use the outdoor pool, but did use the small exercise room which was nice and busy. I did not find the concierge staff to be very helpful and had to figure out many things on my own. You can catch a bus to Seattle in front of the hotel and 20 minutes later you are in downtown. This bus will drop you in Pioneer Square, near the Pike Place Market, and at Westlake Center. If you want to go to Fremont or Ballard, go online to the tripplanner for the bus system and it will give you specific instructions for bus transfers. The bus will drop you right in front of the ballard locks, just tell the driver. The bus is 1.50, ask for a transfer.We stayed at this lovely hotel for a convention. Service was amazing. The housekeeping staff got the rooms down reasonably early. The Concierge was more than helpful. She headed us in the correct direction for a wonderful dinner at Salty's in Redondo Beach. Even gave us free dessert coupons!
The restaurant in the hotel was reasonably priced and the food was very good. 
Our view from our balcony was Mt. Rainier. 
The halls got a little noisy with people visiting but we understand that. The only glitch was a missed wake up call the first morning, but we were still on East coast time so we were up.We stayed at this hotel for one night before starting our Princess landtour. The hotel reception had a lovely smell of freshly baked cookies which were given out at check in and were delicious. The room was spacious and had a coffee maker. There were 2 double beds and the mattresses were really comfortable. We had a lovely buffet breakfast in the restaurant and sat by the outdoor pool in the morning while we waited for our transfer to the airport.If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the airport with above-average shuttle service and great customer service- this is an excellent choice. The rooms are a bit worn at the edges- bathrooms and furniture need updating (bit of a 70's feel), beds are not the best I've seen in Doubletrees- but better than other hotel chains, and the balconies are scary and tacky. However, the rooms are spacious, the vanity outside the bathroom is great for families, and everything seems clean.
If you are looking for a one night hotel before a flight or cruise this would be a fine choice. However, if you are looking for a place for a multiple night stay, prefer modern decor, and are expecting great views- this is not the best selection. 
If you're a business traveler used to Hilton Honors hotels- check out the Hilton Seattle Airport (a block or two down from the Doubletree). I have stayed there as well and found it to be a better selection for a similar cost.We stayed at this hotel after a flight from London. The hotel is conveniently close to the airport. We were given a cookie in a bag when we checked in! The rooms were a good size with 2 large beds. There is an outside swimming pool and tub. All in all a very comfortable place and good start to our holiday with an excellent breakfast.Hotel booked through Princess as part of a cruise to Alaska this was our over night stop after arriving from Heathrow.
Transfer from the airport was easy as they have a dedicated coach transfer. It only took a matter of minutes to get to the hotel.
Friendly welcome and warm cookies handed to you on checkin. All the staff through out our stay were friendly.
We turned down the offer of help with our luggage to our room which turned out to be a mistake. The hotel is so spread out and we just happened to have a room about as far away from reception as possible. We were in wing 5. Tip, accept the offer!!.
Room was very big, well furnished and very clean. The beds are lovely and comfortable. Thick and fluffy towels too!.
Dinner was good, my Wife enjoyed the Maple glazed Salmon. Early start the following day so didn't sample breakfast.
There are information screens in reception detailing flight information.
Booked a Bell Hop to collect our luggage in the morning and this was loaded in the shuttle for transfer when we got to reception. Arrived airport in minutes.We spent the night in this hotel our last evening in Seattle before an 8 a.m. flight. The area around the airport can be iffy, as in many large metropolitan areas. This hotel is clean, neat and offers good value for the money. We felt safe and secure with our small children. AND they have the famous Doubletree chocolate chip cookies!
We were wiped out from a long day and wanted to stay in the room for the night and rest. We ordered clam chowder from the menu - much better than I expected - and finished off fruit from Pike Place Market. 
The hotel has seen its newer days: the carpets are threadbare in some spots and the cement balconies are noticeably empty of furniture. 
But the rooms are a great size, and we noticed large groups of flight attendants from various airlines staying there as well. The hotel employees were very polite and most efficient: we were on our way to our room within 30 seconds, warm cookies in hand. 
I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch.We stay at a lot of hotels, mostly upper-end. This Doubletree has some major service/management problems. 
 I dropped my wife off and left to return the car at Sea-Tac airport. She had five total pieces of luggage. ZERO help from the valet. Indide the hotel as she was trying to get to the checkin area not a single bellhop moved a muscle to help. She was bothered by a rotator cuff and got no help at all getting the bags into the hotel or once in the hotel. She called my cellphone and told me of the miserable service. When I initially arrived at the hotel the LAZY woman at the gated entrance to the hotel could barely rouse herself inside the booth to be bothered with a question about dropping off the bags. Miserable attitude. We've all met ones like her. 
I later found out that the parking and outside car attendants are contracted out to another company. Its service is so awful I won't name it here. Clearly the inside service is as bad as the outside. My wife (normally a mild, retired CEO of a major institution) was livid. This is a big airport hotel with no food service prior to 6AM (except room service) in Seattle where most cross-country flights leave early or very early and you have to get to the airport early. No help with baggage. The other clear impression is that the bellhops don't provide service, they are there to be ""hired."" If you don't ""hire"" them they don't move a muscle. The concept of ""service"" is alien to them and this property. The combination of that plus the outside contracted driveway services is lethal. 
Eventually (probably because of the discussion I had when I returned to the property with him) the front desk manager came up to the room to apologize. That was good service. That was the ONLY good service received. We arrived at the hotel from the Hotel Andra in downtown Seattle. It was excellent., but for an early departure from Sea-Tac one would have to get up very early there. 
We didn't stay anywhere else so I have no other recommendations but this hotel has ""location"" but NO class.Stayed there in the tower for one night for the convienent services to airport and car rentals. Very good shuttle service. I love the doubletree beds! I stayed at one on the gulf in FL and it was better. IMO anywhere at the beach is better though!! It's a bit pricey but I know I will always have a good experience at a Doubletree. Gotta love the cookies too!I've stayed at the Doubletree several times when I need to fly in and out of Seattle. It's a solid 3* hotel and good value.
Pros:
- cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees
- complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins
- nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee
- nice food selection in hotel
Cons:
- parking is expensive - $16/night. If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal
- no breakfast
- no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it
- HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in
Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate. The cons for me aren't a huge issue since I'm just overnighting it, but would be more significant for a prolonged stay.Stayed in the Penthouse for one night at $750, their web discount price - no cancellations, etc. Didn't even get a free parking space. I asked if it could be compted and got a snotty reply from the front desk clerk. You would think I was asking for the moon. We had two cars so that was another $50.The shower looked like a nursing home roll in shower with a short little curtain. Kind of odd and the bath smelled of mildew. Very dated fixtures and furnishing, very dark. The patios were concrete with metal rails and no chairs or tables. Looked like a prison deck outside each window - just plain ugly.
Parking lots were all unattended except one and the gates were acting up. So had to circle the hotel to exit. Probably will pass on this place again. I will wait for the updating before they get more of my money.From the time of check-in, which was fast and courteous, to the time of check-out, we had a great experience at the Doubletree Seatac. Their shuttle service was prompt and they are centrally located to both the airport and a variety of restaurants. Also right around the corner was a Thrifty, so getting our rental car was easy. The bellman made dinner reservations for us and advised us on proper attire for the restaurant. The front desk clerk gave us a business center key card so we could use the computer and internet, which was very helpful as we forgot to print a few things before we left.
The room was beautiful and clean, and the beds were super comfortable! The bathroom had nice amenities as well. Our only criticism is that there was a $16 nightly fee for parking, which we feel should have been part of the cost of the room. Our experience here will prompt us to look to Doubletree for our next trip!Great location next to Sea-Tac airport with shuttle bus pick up and delivery every 15 min. High quality king bed with great linens, big room, quiet air/ventilation system, flat screen TV, large bathroom with separate two sink areas (one outside rest of bathroom). Has a great breakfast buffet in its coffee shop. 
Only negative was terrible in room coffee...surprising based on its Seattle location.I stay at a lot of hotels, but not usually in this price range. It's a little on the high end, but wow! (Not perfect, but very impressive.) Really nice beds and bedding, housekeeping staff were actually friendly and did a nice job; customer service was very good, room was large, nice toiletries, balcony, & airport shuttle. Place is huge and has just about everything you need if you need to stay put by the airport. Would have been nice to have small refrigerator; room service prices and parking fees were steep, and the nearby planes could be a little loud at times. A/C-Heating controls in my room and throughout the hotel (was there for a conference) should be adjusted a little better, but nothing major. Cutest little coffee set up and radio/alarm system. Overall, really enjoyed my stay and look forward to a future stay!This is a good place to stay for a conference or if you need to stay for a night or two near the airport. The room was large and clean. I heard no noise from the airport, or elsewhere. The bed was VERY comfortable (a Serta mattress).
This is a large property with (I believe) five buildings. Out the back of mine (#5) the deck looked out into a forest. The walk from that building to the lobby is about 2-3 minutes. Plenty of eating places nearby, and the bar in the hotel is fine also.
You are charged for parking - $8/night for outdoor parking.I loved the room the moment I walked in. Very large room with 2 queen beds. The whole place is non-smoking so you don't have to worry about getting stuck in a smoking room. Lovely furniture in the room, but it lacks a fridge and microwave, which would come in handy. Nice bathroom, and lots of Neutrogena amenities.
All the pillows in the room were filled with down, so I had to call and request foam pillows. 
They do nickel and dime you here (to the extreme in some cases). In-room internet is not free, though you can go to the lobby area with your laptop and connect wirelessly there (for free). In-room you have to connect with a cable and you pay daily for that. Parking is absolutely outrageous at $16 + tax per day, considering that all the other hotels I saw on the street (except the Hilton) have free parking for guests, including the Red Lion and the Radisson. I decided to park on nearby S 192nd Street and walk the long block; I just don't like being taken advantage of. Local calls are $1.25, though 800 # calls are free. One pleasant surprise is that they have coin-operated washers and dryers sprinkled about the property for only $1 each. Just bring a zip-lock bag of detergent in case you think you might need to use them while here.
There are dining options in the hotel, and there's a Denny's and Jack in the Box right across the street. 
I ended up at this hotel because I bid on a 3-star hotel at Seattle Airport. When you book through Priceline, you nearly always get a flawed room and this was no exception. Although the room was great, it was about as far away from the lobby as you could get (Wing 5, as mentioned in other reviews). Getting there required walking down a hall, going up one floor in an elevator, walking some more, going down another elevator, and walking the rest of the way. About a 10 minute walk in all, but everyone needs more exercise these days. It does get old after a while; always having to walk back to the lobby to use the free internet. Also, my room was right next door to the Mechanical/Sprinkler/Electrical room. Once in a while there would be some vibrating noise, but I could never pinpoint exactly where it was coming from. Somehow I slept through it.First I'll say that we got a great rate at Priceline, far below the travel websites prices for this stay, so we are all-in-all very pleased with our stay.
The room's carpet had a lot of black stains - far more than I'd consider acceptable. But everything else was very nice and clean.
The parking is outrageous at $17+tax per day, but it's not a hidden fee so you can make up your own mind. They do have a free 24-hour airport shuttle that we used to get a rental car at the airport daily and it was very convenient.
What wasn't convenient is the business center. It's a 3 minute walk from the front desk, and they require that you get a new access card each time you visit it from the front desk. But 80% of the time, it won' work. We had to go back REPEATEDLY throughout our stay to get new cards. Others we encountered had the exact same problem. It will work once, then stop working 10 minutes later. It's a terrible system - just let my room key access the business center (which consists of nothing but three computers and a printer anyhow!)
But we do recommend the hotel. Just bring your own laptop and pay for the internet I guess.We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac. We stayed here the last night of our trip to Seattle (got it on Priceline for $46 - not bad!). The bed was very nice, room was clean, we even had a balcony. It wasn't loud at all from the airport but was loud from the hallway (which didn't bother us since we left by 5 am). They were extremely convenient to the airport. The staff people were really helpful and nice. Plus you get a free cookie at check-in! :)
The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!! I can see paying parking for a downtown hotel - but for a hotel at Sea-Tac it seemed absurd to have to pay parking. Overall it was still a reasonable deal though. I would stay again.The hotel is ok for a business trip. Not really top notch new interior, but basically clean. Stayed here the second time in one and a half year. Construction is still!!! going on. They should finish that one. Although I must say, no direct negative impact on my stay.
Free-of-charge Wireless LAN in the Lobby is very ok. Less ok ist the miserable quality of the coffee in the lobby coffee shop.
The parking fee is outrageous - 16$ per day is too much, SEA Airport vicinity or not.
Don´t go here for vacations in the SEA area - too far away from everything but the airport.
Welcome cookie is good and is a nice gesture.I stayed in this hotel for 1 day, as a side trip from Vancouver. Yes it is a bit far from downtown, but very close to the airport. The hotel interior itself is a bit outdated, but the room we stayed in (in the tower) was very pleasant, relaxing and modern. I absolutely loved the warm cookies we were given at check in and the beds in our room were so incredibly soft. I actually miss the beds! The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating. I will definitely stay here again when I visit Seattle.This is the second time I stayed here, in preparation for a flight from Seatac the next morning. I have also booked this hotel twice for my parents, and they also really like it. You can get a great deal on this hotel through Hotwire.
The rooms are spacious and clean. I love the double sinks, works great when two people are in the room rushing to get ready in the morning. 
The elevators in the tower are a bit slow, and the last time we stayed here they conveniently broke down as we were on our way to the airport! So, we had to drag a bunch of luggage down about 9 flights of stairs. I heard that they fixed it quickly though, I was just too impatient (and running late) to wait!
The shuttle service is great, it leaves the hotel every 15 minutes. Service has always been friendly.
And of course...the cookie upon check-in is always my favorite part!
Overall, I wouldn't pay rack rate to stay here, but I always get a great deal so it works for me. Try and get a room in the tower, they seem nicer than the ""wing"" rooms, and are closer to the lobby if you are dragging a bunch of luggage or have to catch the shuttle. Also, I wouldn't recommend staying here if you are coming to visit Seattle, it is far from downtown and they charge a lot for parking. But going to/from the airport, its my favorite place to stay.The lobby and common areas are very nice and updated. The Starbucks kiosk and bar area is pleasant. This is definitely a business travelers' hotel. However, the only thing new about my room was the bed and the granite countertop in the bathroom. The room was outdated otherwise - brass lamps, old chair in the corner, outdated floral curtains, and outdated shower. The pictures are a bit misleading on the Web site - they make the rooms look nicer and newer than they really are. The shower temperature was difficult to adjust and could basically be set to freezing cold or burning hot. I was in one of the wings on the ground floor. One of my colleagues in the tower said she thought she had a better room than what I described and also had complimentary water bottles, that I did not have in my room. Some positive items to note - there are complimentary computers with internet access in the lobby, but the connection is on the slow side. They give you a warm chocolate chip cookie when you check-in.I stayed at this hotel for two nights to attend a conference. The room was very comfortable and the hotel layout and conference space was convenient. I ate several times at the hotel, for breakfast and for a late dinner at the lobby bar, and all the meals were fine. 
This was a very pleasant hotel to stay at and I would recommend it to my friends.I stayed at the Doubletree Seattle Airport in January during a last-minute weekend trip to Seattle. The hotel is basically across the street from the airport, so you do hear the planes, but that wasn't really bothersome for me. The guestrooms are being or have been renovated, and while I was there, they were renovating the lobby, so most parts of the hotel feel very fresh and new.
I booked through Doubletree's website, and was offered an option to upgrade to a premium suite for $30/night if one was available at check-in. Upon check-in, sure enough a suite was available, and I was given a room on the Penthouse floor -- much to my surprise.
The room was fantastic! As you would expect from a suite, it had the bedroom separate from the sitting area, but the room was huge! In the living room area, there was a small dining table, a leather couch, upholstered easy chair with ottoman, and work desk/chair. Also a small bar area, TV, and stereo w/ DVD player. The bedroom was also nice, with the Doubletree ""Sweet Dreams"" bed, clock/radio w/ MP3 input, and another TV. The bathroom was probably as large as the bedroom, with a 2-sink vanity, large soaking tub, and HUGE shower. And that shower -- wow! It had the most water pressure of any shower I've ever seen... if I could figure out how to get my shower at home to do that, I wouldn't think twice!
Floor-to-ceiling windows looked onto the balcony which extended the entire width of the room. The views of the mountains and sunset (and yes, the airport) were very nice. 
As for the rest of the hotel, it is comprised of the 14-story tower (where my room was) and several 3-story ""wing"" buildings. If you were staying in one of the farther out wings, it could be a bit of a hike from the lobby, but the parking lot surrounds the hotel, so at least you'd be able to park close and come/go through one of the card-access-only doors. The elevators for the tower rooms are also a bit of a walk from the lobby (through the meeting room area), which seemed like a strange design.
Two fitness centers are available: one just inside the wing nearest the tower building, and the other between two of the wing buildings overlooking the pool. The outdoor pool is situated in a courtyard area between some of the wings, and looked very nice. The hotel has a lobby area coffee bar, rooftop restaurant, and mid-range lobby restaurant. I ate at the lobby restaurant one night -- nothing spectacular, just average.
Free wi-fi is available in the lobby, as well as free kiosks near the coffee shop if you don't have your computer. Wired Internet access is available in-room for a fee. Parking is a bit steep (at $14/day if I remember correctly), and is also used by people parking for the airport. It is controlled entry, but just know that it's not reserved only for hotel guests.
The staff was polite and professional. When I checked out, the rate I was billed was higher than what it should have been (the regular room + $30 upgrade), but the front desk clerk quickly adjusted the rate to what I had confirmed on the website. She did mention that I shouldn't have gotten the room I did for that rate, but followed that with ""but that's our mistake, not yours."" I know some hotels who would have insisted I pay the higher rate, so I appreciate her doing the right thing for the customer.
Again, I was very impressed with the hotel, and wouldn't hesistate to stay there again next time I'm in Seattle. The location is great, and the free shuttle between the hotel and airport every 15 minutes (24x7) is great.Had a 10-day trip planned for out of the country flying from Seatac. Nice hotel and good rates for park-n-fly. Property does need to update their interior decorating but staff was nice and everything went as expected.I was pleasantly surprised w/this hotel. Only because I did it through hotwire and didn't know what to expect. I was upset w/the parking fee but i did pay half of what i was suppose to pay for two nights (hotwire is the best!!!). So after the initial shock, I was perfectly fine w/the fee. The sevice was excellent from the time I stepped into the hotel. Guest services were so friendly and yes, those chocolate chip cookies are one of the best I've had! The pillow top beds were the most comfortable beds ever! It felt like sleeping on clouds!!! I will definitely come back again!I have used this hotel twice for its park-and-fly package during the holidays. It has always worked out really well. The shuttle service is very good; it runs continuously every 15 minutes, at least during regular airport operating hours. It is right across the street from the airport, so traffic should not be an issue in getting to/from the terminal. I have found the check-in and shuttle driving staff to be friendly and efficient.
Each time I have been assigned a room in the main tower, which is very convenient in terms of parking and lobby/restaurant access. The tower rooms have been renovated in the past few years with modern furnishings and bathroom updates, and I find the beds to be very comfortable. I have never stayed in a room in any of the low-rise wings, so I can't speak to their comfort level. There is one wing that is two sky-bridges away from the lobby. I could see how guests assigned to that wing might complain about long walks to the lobby.
While I have been happy with the rooms and staff, I find the food is getting too expensive for what it's worth. Entrees at the coffee shop priced in the $20+ range should really be $15-19, especially with no salad included (I hear most hotels lose money on food, and I must wonder, is that a self-fulfilling prophecy?). For those guests with cars, I would recommend driving to the Southcenter Mall area (about 2 miles away) to find dinner at one of the many casual-dining restaurants in the area. There is not much to choose from in the immediate airport area, other than 13 Coins, Denny's and a few fast food places.Physically, this is a very tired property. While renovations appear to be underway according to signs, the hotel infrastructure shows its age. Even where renovated, the hotel still needs work. My room, in the renovated tower, had very insufficient lighting and a bathroom that had seen better days. Provided amenities (e.g., soap, shampoo) were low quality. The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold.
Staff wise, this hotel also needs renovation. Service in the more upscale of the two restaurants was almost unbearably slow and the food was cold when it finally arrived after over a hour at our table.Very clean and pleasant stay. Great pool and hot tub.
I only heard 2 airplanes the whole night and they weren't loud. Very nice front desk. The only thing that I was mad about was the $14 per day for parking, which Priceline fails to mention!Stayed here one night when I tagged along with my husband on business. We had an updated room in the Tower and it was very nice. The service in the bar and restaurant was excellent. Would definately stay here again.Stayed here Labor Day weekend 2005. Previous reviews are very acccurate. We stayed in the updated Tower Wing. Room was spacious and very nice. However the rest of this hotel has not seen a renovation since the 60's. Room was very quiet.I stayed at this Doubletree for a conference in October. I had read some reviews and got a little concerned but I was pleasantly surprised. They are remodeling the rooms. I was in wing 3 and it was complete. The beds/linens are nice and comfortable. I didn't use the restaraunts. I would stay here again.I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The room we stayed in was beautiful! Newer furniture, very comfortable bed with nice linens, two large sink areas and super clean. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the spa/pool area and they have a nice lounge with free internet access terminals. Free shuttle to the airport got us to the terminal in about 3 minutes! 
If you are looking for a place to stay near the airport - this is a great one!Rooms are not particularly posh or large. Ours was kind of dingy, definitely in need of a remodeling. My wife and I stayed only 1 night before flying out of Sea-Tac the next morning. Hotel was fine for our purposes, but I wouldn't have wanted a longer stay there. Got room on Priceline for $49. Parking added an extra $12 (exorbitant, but I guess standard for many of the airport hotels). Bed was allegedly a queen, but it seemed more like a double. Business centre internet access was free and open 24 hrs. (must get key from front desk after hours). Pool and whirlpool were nice, but would prefer 24 hr. access like health club. Room service was typically expensive and food was average at best.Stayed 2 nights 09/01-09/03. I got a room (2 queen non-smoking at the furthest wing from the front desk on the first floor, room facing lake) for $35 at priceline. Parking is $12+tax/night. 
Staff was friendly. Got a welcome cookie at check in. I requested main tower room, but she explained it was a convention week and she can only give us the room at the wing. 
Main tower where front desk is located seems to be pretty new and clean, but when I walked into the wing building, there was musty smell, but as I walk deeper into the hall way, the smell is gone. This was a non smoking building but room had a slight bit of cigaretts smell. I was a little disappointed but the smell did not bother me too much. Bed and pillow was surprisingly comfortable and clean. Bathroom area has 2 sinks (one inside bathroom and one outside) so couple can get ready at the same time. 
Hotel located 15 mins away from downtown Seattle. Almost walking distance from the airport. If you have a car to get around the city, I recommend you stay around airport area to save on expensive hotel room.We stayed one night at this hotel. This hotel has huge rooms and is very clean. They even have a heated pool.
The only bummer is that parking is $12 per day (plus tax).
We got an excellent rate on hotwire ($54).The room is hugh, and it's very clean. Although it's closed to the airport, the room is well sound proof. There are restaurants and grocey store in a short driving distance. The self-laundry service is also great. My room had a balconey with a lake view. Overall, highly recommendated.This is a lovely hotel but the service is certainly lacking. The first time I stayed for a conference, the front desk was overwhelmed and not helpful, but I wrote it off to the crush of people. During this second trip, they still were understaffed at the front desk. I waited for my room, was told I was not entitled to breakfast since I hadn't paid full price for my room (I had a discount/points deal). Okay, I thought, I'm saving $60 a night, so I can do without breakfast. I hauled my suitcases (it's a long walk to the tower rooms) only to find that there was someone already in my room. I tried calling the front desk--no answer. Waited a few mintues, not wanting to haul everything all the way back to reception, and called again. It rang and rang--no answer.
When I returned to the front desk I was waved to the back of the line although I had just waited in line to check in. Now the line was a bit longer. I waited while they waved other people ahead of me. Finally I stopped that and stepped up to the counter to let the woman know that I had been issued an occupied room. ""Well, the computer says its empty"" she said, looking at me. ""Are you sure""?
Eventually, we sorted it out and I was given another room. Here's a tip--don't let them put you near the ice makers (in the tower, ask for rooms higher than 10--110,210, 310 and up). The machine was really loud. The walls are very thin. Perhaps the rooms in the wings are better. I assume I was given the cheap room because of my dimished status, but just be careful where they put you.
Now, having said all of that, it is a clean, safe hotel and is probably fine for the night before or after a trip, but I'd avoid a long stay.The Doubletree Seattle Airport is a large hotel convenient to the airport. We stayed there for one night after arriving on a late flight, and had gotten a very affordable rate on Hotwire. The room was very large and clean, and the warm cookies on arrival were delicious. The bed was quite comfortable. We also had our own balcony overlooking a pond. 
This property is quite large (900+ rooms) and is very spread out. Our room was about a 10-minute walk from the front desk. While we didn't mind the walk after our long flight, travelers who want an easy trip to and from their room should request accommodations that are as accessible as possible.
All in all a fine experience. I would stay here again.We stayed one night at the Doubletree because of its location right next to the airport. We had a room in the tower. The appearance of the room may have indicated that it was recently renovated. We were very pleased by the decor, balcony and double vanities, one inside the bathroom and one outside. The bedding was quit plush, the best we had during our visit to the Seattle, Burlington, Port Angeles, Forks and Mt. St. Helens areas. The large pool was heated and very warm. I would estimate the water temperature to be around 85-90F. Beware - this property is very large with many rooms.The Doubletree was very convenient to Sea-Tac Airport. The price was right, the rooms were large (with balconies) and the warm cookies at check-in were good. Even though there were a lot of guests at the hotel, I appreciated not hearing any outside noise in our room. Large pool and hot tub.Stayed at this hotel night before leaving for Alaskan cruise and then again on return. Found the staff friendly and helpful. Loved the free warm cookies on arrival - a nice touch.
The rooms we stayed in both times were well furnished, large and clean. The beds were very comfortable and there were nice big pillows.
We had a breakfast and a lunch in the coffee shop, off the lobby area - both meals were very good and the service quick and friendly.
Hotel has free airport shuttle every 15mins which was also good.
The swimming pool was a good size, very clean and a pleasant temperature - my swim was most enjoyable - plenty of clean fluffy towels poolside.
Very impressed with the hotel.I stayed here for one night in May, 2005 -- my flight arrived at midnight and I was renting a car the following morning to drive north and just wanted a comfortable bed near the airport. I reserved and purchased the room on Priceline (3 stars, $45). The aiport shuttle circulates frequently and drives you the very short distance to the hotel (practically across the street from the airport). The lobby had a ""classy"" feel -- just what you would expect from an upscale property. I was assigned a room in one of the wings (not in the tower which is touted as being better elsewhere on this page). It was 1:00 a.m. when I reached my room and I could not make the key card work in my door. I went down the hall to a house phone and phoned the hotel operator who sent someone to assist me immediately. He got the door open on the first try with no problem and three minutes later, my phone rang and it was the hotel operator ""Just checking to make sure you were able to get in, dear"". The room was clean. The bed was very, very comfortable. The curtains really darkened the room. A lobby cafe has inexpensive breakfasts (fruit, yogurt, and granola ""parfait"" for $3). I didn't explore the swimming pool or health club. All in all, a perfect place to stay if you are arriving at SEA-TAC airport late at night or are leaving on an early flight. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.I thought the Doubletree was an above average airport hotel. My friend and I always judge a hotel by a number of factors and the Doubletree scored well for water pressure, room space, temp control (how well the AC works), beds & bonus points for a warm cookie on check in!
The only issue I really had was that our room was sooooooo far away. We got in at midnight from our flight and then had to drag our luggage (well technically the bell hop did most of the dragging but still) the very last room in the very last building. That aside, everything else was more that sufficient. Oh yeah, we also didn't like the fact that for $1 the vending machine gave you a teeny tiny dasani! 
But for the price I paid on Priceline, I would absolutely stay here again if I needed to be near the airport.I pass through Seatte, either for business or vacation, several times per year and I use Priceline if I need a room close to Sea-Tac Airport. A $35 bid for a 3-star room in the Sea-Tac hotel zone will often get you into the Doubletree. By the time Priceline adds on taxes and fees, the cost goes up to $47. Because of my flight schedules, I merely use the Doubletree for sleeping. I arrive at night and then catch an early flight the next morning. Therefore I can't comment on the hotel's public amenities; I never use them. 
This Hilton-managed, chain hotel is almost certainly the largest in Sea-Tac. It has hundreds of rooms, some of which can be quite a hike from the lobby. Be aware of that if you have a lot of luggage. Once you get to your room, however, it will probably be reasonably clean and reasonably quiet (except when school groups or conventioneers have filled the place). The matresses are reasonably comfortable and the linens are of reasonable quality. The free shuttles to and from the airport operate with reasonable efficiency. The warm cookie the desk clerk gives you at check-in is a nice touch. Nevertheless, there is nothng remarkable about this hotel. It could be on any airport strip in any mid-size city in North America. 
Across the street from the Doubletree is one of the locally-owned ""Roasters"" bar and grill restaurants. It is a good place for a beer (lots of drafts on tap) and some roast chicken or a burger and fries. For more upscale dining, check out the 13 Coins. That restaurant is on the same side of the street as the Doubletree and about two blocks north. The food there is good, but a dinner for two will probably cost you more than the room at the Doubletree.The first time I booked here, I was very impressed with the property. There is a beautiful pool and jacuzzi surrounded by huge rhodedendrons. The rooms are huge and it's right across from the airport with round the clock shuttles. Book through hotwire and get the $100 room for half price.We stayed in this hotel in October of 2004. We were in a great suite in the tower. Our suite was very large, with two bathrooms, one with a big jacuzzi tub, plenty big enough for two, and one off the bedroom area. When you walked in the door to your right was a wetbar and a large kitchen sort of area, keep walking and you come to a dining table for about 4 people. Next you come to a living room with a sleeper sofa, coffee table and chair, a television in an armoire and next to that a desk and chair. There was a seperate sleeping area with its own TV armoire and chair. The suite was on the corner of the building with a view of the planes taking off from the bedroom and a view of a lake and the elevators from the living/dining room. The whole suite had no outside walls, just windows and a wrap around, good sized balcony. We were very satisified with the suite, and the service we received. The cookies upon check-in were a very nice treat. At only $150.00 or so we found it to be an excellent deal, and the clerk at the front desk waived the parking charge for us when we inquired about it. We found the best price was the net direct rate at Doubletree.com, however if you get that rate it is charged immediatly and non-refundable. We liked it so much that we are going back in April.Not the best of hotels. I was in one of the wings. Hotel is old and visably unappealing. It says its on 35 acres, but they literally use all that area. Parking gates to get in and out of lot. Very big hotel, not very good hotel though. If I returned to Seattle, I would most likely skip this place.This was a horrible place to stay. We stayed in September and had the worse time. We check in with no problems, but we go to our room after visitng some sites, we had no heat (a low of 35 was in order for the evening), we had no hot water, and wet carpet. We complained when we checked out (which they were going to charge us more), but nothing was done. I ended up writing the corporate offices who ended up giving us the room for free. I guess it made up for our bad stay and our cancelled flight home.I stayed here on November 7-8, 2004. When I read the previous reviews, I asked if my reservation was for a wing or a tower room. It was for a wing room but the reservation staff courteously changed it to a tower room. 
Access to the tower is by external glass elevators. My room was large, quiet and had a small balcony. There was a stain on the carpet but otherwise it was clean and well maintained. The room was equipped with a coffee maker, iron & ironing board and blow dryer and there were 2 sinks - one inside the bathroom and one outside. The room did not have a refrigerator or microwave; the high speed internet connection in the room cost about $10. There is no complimentary breakfast; there is a coffee shop and an espresso bar that also sells yogurt, bagels and pastries. The hotel has a complimentary airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. 
I was attending a large conference held at the hotel. My co-workers with wing rooms said they were 'okay' and they heard some noise from neighboring rooms. The wing hallways had a damp smell. One wing building was closed for renovation.
All staff were very courteous and helpful. 
For me the location worked well since I was attending events at the hotel and didn't have to rent a car to get there. If I had transportation and didn't have events at the hotel, I would look a few miles away for a better buy for the money.Just stayed at the Doubletree at Seatac and was a little apprehensive based on the reviews contained here. However, there was no need to worry. I stayed in the tower and the room, while in need of some updating, was clean, spacious, and very comfortable. I did have a problem with the telephone and it was quickly fixed by the maintenance department. I had no other problems at this hotel and would gladly stay here again.I've stayed at this location a few times before and was generally satisfied but on my third visit I discovered that the bed linens had not been changed. The bed appeared properly made up but I first spotted some stains on a pillow and then numerous body hairs scattered on the bottom sheet.
The night manager who took my complaint listened passively and, without an apology, informed me that a bellhop would be sent over with a key to another room.Nice big rooms, quiet, sink in shower area and outside. Clean with nice beds. Problems were parking is $14 a night, Internet is $10 a day, local calls $1.25 plus 15 cents a minute after 60 minutes. Huge place - you'll need a map to find your room - drive to it don't walk. Only 12 TV channels with HBO.We got a great rate through Priceline. They rate it as 3-stars and we would agree.
The hotel is right on ""rental car return boulevard"" so it was real easy to take our car back.
The hotel charges for parking, but if you are taking your car back after check-in, they will validate your ticket and not cost a thing to stay for a short period.
Check-in was easy and the room was huge. We have never stayed in a Doubletree before, but certainly will in the future.This hotel disappointed. As a Doubletree, I expected a GOOD three star property for my stay on August 27, 2004. What I found was rather run down and shabby. We were told we had a great view of the ""lake"" from our room. There was no lake visible. The bathroom was dirty and stained. Carpet was old as were the other furnishings.
Coffee shop service was horrible. Waited forever to be seated and there were only 3 others in the place. Waitress never brought the items we requested and the order was askew. We had to go searching for our check to pay it. This Doubletree is very tired, and more like a 2 star property than a 3 star. It looks nice on the outside,, but inside it is very shabby and used.Yes the Hotel is very handy to the Airport, which was great, & it was priced competitively. BUT it looks very old, out dated. My Duvet & furnishings in my room looked very used & the room itself was miles away from the lobby - thought I was staying in Seattle not Las Vegas! I travel every 2wks & spend many a night in a hotel room. The staff were helpful but I wouldn’t stay here again.I couldn't believe it, when I had to pay an additonal $12 to park my car. You would think that if your spending the night parking would be free. Plus, another additional charge of $8 for internet access. Room was acceptable, except I could hear people walking in the room above me, so needless to say I didn't get a good night sleep. The cafe where I had breakfast I was seated at the table, but never was helped to take my order.
 I will stay at another hotel in the area that has free parking, free internet access, and free continental breakfast. I won't be back.This hotel is close to the terminal building but still requires a minibus transfer. (quick and easy)
Top tip for this property is to request a room in the main tower. We did this by E-mail in advance and sent it to the Hilton group. I received a reply and when I checked in, got a tower room without asking. These rooms are generally a better standard than the main outbuildings, but could still do with some minor renovating.
Service was top notch on the front desk and very friendly. Hotel decor has a distinctly 80's feel about it in terms of decor, but you get what you pay for. 
$80 (£44) for a large, clean, comfortable room and an on airport location - you can't really go wrong - even if you get one of the ""shabbier"" rooms other reviewers have mentioned. I will stay here again.This place is quite a dump. The rooms are old, the carpet dirty and dingy. 
Room service was so slow that I called to tell them not to send the order because of the slow service, the order magically appeared 3 minutes later. I suspect that the lazy service person realized that she would not get her delivery money and rushed it right over. 
Location is OK (near SEATAC airport).
Don't stay here if you have any other choice near the airport.I stayed here a couple of weeks ago just because and had a really enjoyable evening. Had the pleasure of dining at the resturante, Seaports and using my entertainment card. The bill with tip was $26 this was for NY steak and crab cakes-2 meals. The property is located directly across the street from the airport and parking is $12. The facility offers an outdoor heated pool that is opened until 11pm and upon check in the guests are offered warm cookies. Nice! Great weekend prices on Priceline. Check biddingfortravel for the best hotel prices in the world.Booked this through priceline. WARNING- if you do this, you are bottom of the barrel with the staff. Was disappointed with the room. Small, stuffy, carpet was worn and stained and it was on the main floor right along the parking lot...motel style. Had a big spider in the bathroom 20 min after checking in. Asked to change to a higher floor (there's only 2) and they said they were full BUT if I paid more they could find me a room in the (original hotel) tower which has 14 floors. After some arguing, they put us there with no charge. As we were walking out of our ""motel"" room, a new couple had already been put there! No one even came to check the cleanliness. We had washed our hands so we'd used a couple towels, used the bathroom...etc. Though we left it clean, i still think it was unsanitary and those poor people looked shocked to see someone coming out of their room. Alot of flight staff stay here on the 2nd floor. Priceline rooms seem to be on the ground floor. Call the property directly and insist on a 2nd floor room. Might help. The tower room was better but the carpet was very dirty and there was a huge clump of long, black hair on the floor of the bathroom. 
The positives were they have those ""sweet sleeper"" beds or whatever so it was a good sleep, pool area looked nice and hottub was relaxing, and they give you cookies on check in and check out.After reading a few of the reviews of this hotel, I was a little worried about it. However, once we checked in a was pleasantly surprised and it turned out to be a very nice hotel to spend a night pre-cruise.
The hotel is very close to the airport and there can be some noise from the planes. As we are not light sleepers this did not bother us.
Check in was pleasant and the staff was helpful. The shuttle was prompt both picking us up and dropping us off to catch our Shuttlexpress bus to the cruise pier. Waitstaff in the coffee shop was friendly and attentive.
We were assigned a room in the tower. There are several 4 or 5 story buildings that are connected together and could make it a challange to find your room but we had no problems at all. The room itself was spacious but not overly large and had a nice bathroom. The room was clean and comfortable. 
There are two fitness rooms but neither is overly large. They did have up to date equipement. There is one outdoor pool and hot tub that we did not use. There were two onsite restaurants, on sports lounge and a coffee bar area with pasteries. The prices in the restaurant were a little high for what we wanted to pay so we had dinner in the coffee shop. Still not inexpensive but it didn't break the budget either. The hot food was hot and cold foods were cold. Overall a decent meal. 
My overall impression with our stay was this is a very nice hotel close to the airport. I would not be disappointed if we purchased through Hotwire and received this hotel again.This is a pretty rundown hotel. We did not choose it. Our travel agent booked the hotel through a cruise company as part of a package deal. It was about fifteen minutes away from town and very close to the airport. We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee. The service at the hotel coffee shop was really slow and the waiter seemed really bothered by having to come to our table to see what we wanted. The soup was brought to us pretty cold, but he seemed to vanish so we couldn't complain. Even Denny's would probably have been better.We stayed 3 days at the Doubletree Hotel in July 2006. The front desk staff were grouchy, uninterested and not pleasant to deal with. We experienced this poor attitude with a few other staff members within the hotel. We were quite surprised as this was the only hotel during our two week Washington State vacation that did not provide a fantastic experience. Too bad considering the hotel facilities are lovely and the rooms are comfortable and spacious. I would not stay at a Doubletree Hotel again. It must be an unhappy place to work because it sure comes through to the customer. Spend your money at a hotel that does not see guests as interruptions in their day.Our stay in this hotel was poor. We got to the bedroom at 2 A.M., after a flight from Alaska. Then we found a used towel and wet washcloth in the bathroom and no soap or any thing else but towels and washcloths. Then I turned back the covers on the bed and found that the sheets had been used, both the top and bottom sheets were all crumpled up at the feet at my side. We slept in them anyway, as we only had 2 1/2 hrs to sleep there. Have you ever slept in someone unknown to you's dirty sheets. It is not nice. You can't help but wonder if they may have had some kind of disease. I mentioned the problems the next morning to the desk clerk. She said she would tell the manager.We took a short weekend trip to Seattle 6/03-6/06. Because of the very high prices in Seattle we decided to stay closer to the airport where the prices are more reasonable. We used Priceline and bid far too high I realized after looking on this site and seeing what people have bid and what was accepted. We did not have a problem with noise even with the close proximity to the airport. We rented a car and there was no problem getting around Seattle. Travel time to Seattle was no more than 15 minutes and the parking was never an issue for us except at the hotel. The parking here is pricey..about 15.00/day. So if you are bidding on Priceline factor that into what you are willing to pay. I tried to bargain with the hotel staff about the price to no avail. There is also a 4.95/hr or 9.99/day charge to use the internet in your room. There is an area in the hotel where there is internet access free of charge. I did like this hotel and will stay again but will bid a much lower price considering all the extras that can be attached. I though the hotel was in good shape and the walk from the front desk to our room was not bad at all. The rooms were clean and the staff was helpful.My family needed a hotel room for Thursday May 18, 2006. I walked into the lobby and was greeted with a warm inviting woman. I asked if they had rooms available and she responded yes. The staff was friendly and helpful. We went to our room and it was small but very comfortable. The bed was a pillow -top mattress with down comforter and 6 pillows. The sheets were extremely soft. We had a view of the lake. 
Later that night we went to the Lounge inside the hotel where they have several computers with free internet access. The waitress was very accomadating while I was researching more vacation plans. She offered crayons and paper to the my daughters and served them each milk (that I ordered) in nice plastic cups with straws and lids. 
The airport shuttle leaves every 15 minutes and it only takes about 3 minutes to get to the airport. Very convienent when you are flying out at 6:40 am.
I highly reccommend this hotel! A gem in the Seatac area. One thing to note, they do charge for parking.After a miserable stay at the Radisson Sea-Tac, we thought the Doubletree would be heaven. Well, not quite. It took us three tries to get a decent room. The hotel is divided into different wings. The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty. The decor and bathroom are straight from the 70's. The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture. Our first room's AC wasn't working. The seond room was just gross. Finally, I requested to be put in the ""tower"" (the new wing). They said king beds weren't currently available in the new wing. I said I didn't care, we'll take two doubles! Once we got in the new wing, it was MUCH better. No airplane sounds, believe it or not. An excellent airport shuttle helped us catch our flight the next morning.Best deal around! The rooms are well-appointed, and location is perfect for those early morning flights.
No doubt about it. It will be the Doubletree for us next time!We booked our hotel room through Priceline and got a great deal. The hotel is divided into 6 zones connected by either corridors or ""skyways"". Our room was in the last one -- zone 5b. The reception area itself was elegant and well-maintained, but the rooms were in need of maintenance. Our room had a slightly musty smell and stained carpets.
On the plus side, the staff was very helpful and tried to fulfill our requirements in every way possible. The hotel has a lot of amenities such as restaurants, bars, gyms, a business center and a swimming pool and jacuzzi. Most of the rooms face Bow Lake as did ours and it is a beautiful view from the balcony.
Budget travellers be warned -- there is a $12 parking fee per night.Our hotel room was booked through a third-party company such as Expedia, Priceline, or Travelocity. The room we were in was in need of a make-over. The carpets were a disaster with stains and there were smudges and gouges in the wall. We were two doors down from the ice machine which was noisy all night long. Repairs were being undertaken at night and the repairmen were very noisy. Housekeeping knocked on our door at 8am wanting to clean our room. If you're on vacation, don't expect to sleep in.We visited this hotel on the warmest day Seattle had experienced in over a year. We got a peek of the beautiful pool and for several hours my family enjoyed the water and large lounge area. The pool area was well stocked with towels. Our large room was a treat for me, with large windows and a balcony. The beds were very comfortable. We visited the weight room that was well supplied with machines, weights, tv's and kept very cold. The halls connecting building to building are glass and you fell like your in a garden. The Expresso bar was a busy stop in the morning and I noticed you could check in for Alaska Airlines(kosk) at the lobby of the hotel which is easy as well. It was a very enjoyable experience!double tree par hilton,passage obligatoire pour vol annulé.Très bel hôtel avec services hôteliers excellents.Escale non prévue avec un ticket de 10$ par personne pour le repas ,pas très généreux de la part de la compagnie,je ne la citerai pas,mais évitez canadian air lines!...zur Begrüßung gab es dort an der Rezeption für jeden schon mal einen Schokoladen-Cookie. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und entgegenkommend, so wie man es vom Hilton Standard gewohnt ist. Die Zimmer waren sehr geräumig und sauber, die Klimaanlage funktionierte tadellos, was sich durch eine entsprechende Kühle im Raum auszeichnete. Aber ein kurzes ausschalten der Anlage und ein öffnen der Balkontür sorgte recht schnell für ein angenehmes Raumklima. Die Betten hatten natürlich den Standart so wie man ihn sich wünscht und erhofft. Wir hatten das Zimmer bereits einige Zeit vor der Anreise gebucht und bekamen beim einchecken gleich ein Upgrad und wurden in der Penthouse Etage untergebracht. Neben einem wunderbaren Panoramablick war auch das Frühstück inclusive. Letzteres war übrigens auch sehr gut und reichhaltig, es fehlte eigentlich an nichts. Wenn man das Preis-Leistungsverhältins betrachtet lagen wir einiges unter dem was ein vergleichbares Hotel in der Innenstadt gekostet hätte, zumal die Fahrt mit dem eigenen Mietwagen in die Innenstadt gerade mal ca. 15 Minuten gedauert hat. Fazit, ein durchaus empfehlenswertes Hotel mit einem sehr guten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis.guteZimmer, gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis, hätte mir auch die erste Übernachtung in der Stadt sparen können, da zu teuer, ca. 20 Minuten in die Innenstadt, ca. 5 Minuten zum Flughafen
einziger Wermutstropfen, hohe ParkgebührenPrima ervaring in dit zeer verzorgd hôtel. Uitstekende ligging dichtbij de luchthaven. Zeer gewaardeerde shuttledienst. Zeer ruime kamers met alle faciliteiten, ook op het gelijkvloers. Prima ontbijt. Ideaal als eerste basis voor mensen die Alaska willen bezoeken.如果你要在SEA附近过一夜，别犹豫了就这家吧。
官网提前订的价格，税后79USD，非常非常不错的价格。Hilton金卡会员入住，还送了饮料券、房间升一级、免费网络。
房间很宽敞，还有一个挺大的阳台。对于大部分美国的DoubleTree，这家已经算是硬件条件不错的了。浴室备品是标配的瑰柏翠。
酒店大堂的工作人员非常热情，之前我有一份快递先送到酒店的，Checkin的时候没查到，他们说回头找到帮我送到房间。结果没15分钟就送到了，非常有效率！
机场Shuttle大概30分钟一次，算是机场附近酒店标配吧。Checkout的时候看到不少身着制服的crew/pilot，以及来SEA参加cruise的游客。总之这家酒店在生意不错的情况下还能维持这样的低价，非常让人满意！Nach einem langen Flug in die USA hatte ich am Anfangsabend das Doubletree aus alter Verbundenheit zu Hilton gewählt. Und ich wurde nicht enttäuscht. Nach einem freundlichen Empfang bekam ich ein Zimmer mit Flughafenblick, der gleichzeitig einen Blick auf die dahinter liegenden Berge einschloss. Das Zimmer war nichts besonderes, aber geräumig, sauber und hatte einen Balkon (wie alle Zimmer im Hauptgebäude). Die Bar im Haus war ebenfalls ansprechend. Ein großzügig bemessenes Frühstücksbuffet gab mir einen guten Start in den Tag. Der Shuttlebus verkehrt nach Bedarf und in 10 Minuten ist man am Airport bzw. an der Bahnstation in Richtung Seattle. Ich würde dieses Hotel immer wieder wählen.We thought we were getting a really good deal on hotwire so we were really excited UNITL we checked in. We were forced to pay 16 dollars (actually over 17 after tax) a night just to park! You have to pay the parking because they basically lock you in the parking lot where you must use your key to get out. Then you had to PAY for internet per night! OMG this is a three star and they act like they are on such a budget they must charge for EVRYTHING! We asked for a bottle of shampoo and the housekeeper had to verfy when we were checking out before she would give us a tiny bottle of shampoo! We needed a cart to bring our luggage in and they threw a fit!!! They did not want us to take a cart even though our room was at least a mile from the lobby! This is a HUGE hotel and I feel because we booked on Hotwire they stuck us in the crappy and far point of the hotel. I would NOT stay here again UNLESS I wanted to throw my hard earned money away like I just had to do! The only good think about this place was the free cookie they give you when you check in....however with what I paid extra I could have bought a whole tin of cookies!Utilizamos este hotel nuestra ultima noche en Seattle ,porque nuestro vuelo salía bastante pronto y no queríamos darnos otro madrugón. 
Llegamos tarde esa noche y no encontraban la reserva , y eso que nosotros la teniamos en nuestro Portatil y se la mostramos, nos hicieron ir a unos ordenadores al otro extremo de Recepción para que imprimieramos la Reserva y la entregáramos , la conexión era lentísima y como era gratuita se cortaba cada cinco minutos . 
Es un hotel muy cercano al aeropuerto y esta lleno de gente, nos dieron una habitación en otra torre y para descargar las maletas necesitamos ir en coche de paseo por todo el parking hasta encontrar nuestra entrada . Sigo sin entender como en hoteles de esta categoría no hay botones que te acerquen las maletas con un carro a la habitación ??? Viajamos con nuestra hija y con 4 maletas , mochilas , chaquetas ...etc necesitamos hacer dos viajes hasta cargar todo en el ascensor y luego caminar casi medio km arrastrando las ruedas de las maletas por la moqueta hasta la habitación .....
La habitación correcta , buen tamaño , camas cómodas y grandes.
El desayuno bueno , se puede optar por el buffet o por comprar café y bollos en la tienda situada antes de recepción . 
El Buffet dispone de desayuno americano o continental,la calidad es buena 
Hay servicio de autobús al aeropuerto que se encuentra muy cerca , unos 10 minutos 
Para mi gusto es un hotel demasiado grande , con demasiada gente y mal organizado , pero muy bien situado para ir al aeropuerto.Jag har visserligen inget att jämföra med vid Seattle Airport men fann Double Tree ett urtmärkt och prisvärt alternativ. Vi hade ett dubbelrum med två sängar som var rymligt och lätt att vistas i. Prövade inte restaurangen men rumsservicen var bra. Rymlig gratis shuttlebus till avgångshallen var 20:e minut, tar ca 10 minuter.Överhuvudtaget lugnt och trivsamt.Das Doubletree überrascht. Obwohl es von außen einen etwas ""klotzigen"" Eindruck macht, wurde ich vom Inneren angenehm überrascht. Das Personal ist sehr angenehm und ging stets auf meine Wünsche ein. Beispielsweise war mein reserviertes Zimmer bei meiner Ankunft etwas kühl. Bei der Rezeption angerufen und umgehend ein neues, warmers Zimmer erhalten - und sogar mit besserer Aussicht. :-) Und diese empfehle ich auch jedem: die Aussicht zum Flughafen hin, ist einen eventuellen Aufpreis sicherlich wert (anstatt irgendwo im hinteren Bereich versteckt zu warden).Das Doubletree am Flughafen Seattle überrascht durch einen für Doubletree ungewohnt großen Komplex von mehreren Gebäuden, umgeben von einer Unmenge von Parkplätzen. Dennoch spürt man im Haupthaus ein gewisses, angenehmes Ambiente, das an Wildlife, Nature und Abenteuer erinnern soll. Viel Holz, ein offener Kamin und eine gewissen Heimeligkeit, soweit das bei der Größe geht.
Die Zimmer sind Standard, von der Größe her allerdings gut. Die Einrichtung ist typisch amerikanisch und in Ordnung, reißt aber nicht vom Hocker. Schön ist der Balkon am Zimmer im Hauptgebäude.
Die Anlage hat ein Pool und auch Waschmaschinen für die Gäste. 
Angenehm überrascht haben die gastronomischen Angebote im Haus, das Frühstück war sehr gut!Hotel.com's tilbud inkl. morgenmad var utroligt attraktivt. Tilgengæld var værelset i en fløj, som kun var slidt motelstandard og ikke vanlig Hilton hotelstandard. Det ville også have været for godt til at være sandt til prisen, men det burde alligevel have fremgået af beskrivelsen!
Havde en meget dårlig oplevelse ved poolen, hvor der manglede badehåndklæder. Efter 4 henvendelser til receptionen og ventetid over 1 time lukkede poolen uden at vi havde fået håndklæder.
Parkering på 20USD er urimelig høj i forhold til normal US-standard og internet på værelset er heller ikke gratis. Hellere inkludere det i værelsesprisen i stedet for at irritere gæsterne.
Morgenmadsrestaturanten var suveræn! Og beliggenheden 500m fra indkørslen til lufthavnen kunne ikke være bedre.This is definetly a ""mega-hotel."" It's huge. Sprawling wings and a huge tower, it's EASY to get lost finding your room. The staff is generally nice and you can actually walk from the airport (10-15 mins max ) if you don't have much luggage.
The rooms are pretty small, but the bathroom and on the large side. All rooms have baconies, although with no furniture. The rooms are newly renovated, although not as nice or modern as a Marriott room would be (i.e. no plasma tv).
Nice pool area with a whirlpool which closes strictly at 11PM. You definetly feel safe and secure in this hotel as a lot of airline crew stay here as well.
Great place for a quick night, not bad if you have kids either.This hotel is a nice size and is convenient to the airport and restaurants. The fitness room is small but the bedrooms are standard. The staff was very helpful with all my business and pesonal needs. The hotel gave me 3 vouchers for $10 of any meal since I am a Hilton honors platinum members. That worked well for me since the food at the hotel is fairly pricey.Had an 4:00 wake-up call to catch an early plane that never came. Also (perhaps because we used a discount travel site) our room was a very long way away in a noisy area of the hotel....had to walk down several halls, take an elevator up walk again, take another elevator down and walk down more halls. The rooms were far from soundproof. I could hear everything going on in the next rooms as well as doors slamming throughout the night. The plus were the comfortable beds.
The $16 charge ($20 for valet) for nightly parking was ridiculous.I was here for another business meeting. We used the meeting facilities and team and WOW is all I can say. A very attentive team. Our every need was met before we even asked for it. The catering staff, banquet sales staff, A/V team, set up and banquet management were all 100 percent superb. 
The meeting rooms are very large and comfortable. The A/V equipment is up to date and work great. The food is really good and the catering and banquet team are nothing but hard working and smiles. I strongly advise this space for anyone looking to have a large event or conference.
The sleeping rooms were very spacious and comfortable. The beds are soft, but not too soft and the linens are warm and cozy. I loved all of the amenities in my room. Fluffy towels, nice shower head, beautiful balcony that was almost larger than my apartment in New York!!
All of the food was really nice. Service was always with a smile and always on time. Everything I tried, I really enjoyed. The eggs benedict was BEST!! 
Front desk staff was very nice. A warm welcome check in coupled with a yummy warm cookie. Can't beat it. 
All and all, this is a really great place for a stay or for an event, or both. It is very close to the airport, not to far from downtown Seattle, and just a great place to be.I loved the Doubletree Seatac. The hotel is beautiful and our room was very large. After 2 weeks on a land/sea tour of Alaska the bed was like sleeping on a cloud with down pillows. They provide free HOT wonderful cookies and lemonade or punch in the lobby. The shuttle to airport was on time, but it was a little difficult to find our way into the airport from the dropoff point from the driver's directions or lack thereof. Also, we had to move a table to plug in our coffee pot and the light in the large room could have been better. It is also a long walk from the lobby to our room. Might be difficult for seniors, and they gave us a handicap room because we wanted 2 queen beds. Since I needed the walk to get rid of the calories from the cookie it was ok. They also had free internet in the bar. Would stay there again for sure.No problems here. great view from airport side rooms, beware the glass elevator if you get a high storey room its quite a way up there. breakfast good but on one evening i had the 'juicy angus' burger in the restaurant, would not recommend it. Overall staff very helpful and airport shuttle available 24/7.After reading the reviews here, my family was VERY disappointed with the hotel. 
First, the hotel is going through major renovations in the tower part of the hotel. 
We stayed in the village part of the hotel, which were found to be old and dark. The room was like staying in a basement, an old and mildew smell. The A/C put out hot air. We put the A/C on 60 and the room immediately heated the room up 89 degrees.
I could not recommend this hotel.I stayed in this hotel for three business days, Big rooms with HD TV, beds are good, everything is enjoyable, available and comfortable but at a cost. Breakfast and Internet in the room is not included and must be paid for quite a bit extra.. especially internet is quite costly, where free wifi can be found allmost everywhere in the Seattle area, this seems a bit out of wack. Parking is also not free and costs even more then breakfast!. Good point is the very nice and relaxed atmosfere in the hotel, I really enjoyed staying in the bar after a hard days work..Das Doubletree Seattle Airport liegt in Sichtweite des Flughafens. Obwohl es kaum mehr als 500 m vom Airport zum Hotel sind, fährt alle 20 Minuten ein kostenloser Shuttlebus.
Das Hotel bietet entsprechend seiner Sternebewertung (4) geräumge und saubere Zimmer, die gemütlich eingerichtet sind. 
In der Nähe befinden sich zahlreiche Restaurants.
Vom Flughafen aus fährt die S Bahn alle 10 bis 20 Minuten für $ 2,50 in die Innenstadt von Seattle. Die Fahrt dauert ca. 40 Minuten.
Tipp: Lassen Sie sich beim Check Inn ein Zimmer mit Seeblich im Wing 4 geben!!!riesiger Hotelkomplex ca. 1000 Zimmer, ordentlich eingerichtet, schöner TFT-Screen, sonst üblicher Standard, habe nicht viel getestet, da ich nur gut sieben Stunden Aufenthalt im Hotel hatte, konnte im Queensizebett gutschlafen, Badezimmer geht in Ordnung, leider schon etwas älter und auch nicht ganz ruhig, Hörte leider die Eismaschine gegenüber meines Zimmers -die sind in allen abgehenden Flügeln am Gang, am besten ein Zimmer am Ende eines Flügels erbieten, Airportshuttle kostenfrei alle 20min 24/7.... kurze Fahrt ca. 5-10min.トランジットに泊まりました。空港から程近く、施設も充実しているのでいいホテルです。
それにしては値段がちょっと高い気がします。Stayed for 5 days. Location was right across from the airport so noise can carry a bit. Had a room in the tower. Parking can be tough at night when the lot is full. Had to wait for the elevator a few nights during the conventions and a penthouse party one night. Can seem a bit hectic in the lobby when conventions are going on. Free internet on the computers in the cafe/bar area. Room was clean and comfy. Shower pressure was okay. Overall a nice stay and a great value for the price I got. But avoid the common area when there are exhibitors and such. =)For $84 including tax & service fee via Priceline this was a great deal. Airport shuttle runs 24hrs/day - my [delayed flight] arrival @ 2:15am - shuttle was waiting. Very close to airport. Check-in was fast - was given TWO cookies! - and a room in the main tower (for the least amount of walking). The room was large and comfortable. The beds were great and plenty of pillows. Room had a sink/mirror area outside the bathroom and a second sink/mirror area in the bathroom with toilet/bath/shower.
Room was very quiet - no noise from street/airport or hallway.
Only downside was no free Internet in the rooms - there was a wired Internet connection in the room for which you could pay by the hour; free wireless could be had by going down to the main lobby - and room service and parking (which I didn't use) would be very expensive.
Hotel is within walking distance of a number of eating places.On first glance this hotel looked like a wonderful bargain from Priceline. And, no doubt the price was better than if we had booked it elsewhere. However there were lots of issues. Let's start with the worst: the nice white throwpillows that Doubletree puts on each bed proclaiming the joys of a comfy night's sleep were covered with someone else's hair. Lots and lots of it. Bad enough that this was the case but these same pillows were resting on our bed pillows. Really gross and very unhealthy to boot. Our ground floor room was by chance for handicapped use. The architect must have been drunk since in order to reach the bath towels from the tub you had to clim,b out of the tub and walk across the bathroom. No place to hang a towel near the tub. Now, back to the pillows: the bed pillows were the composition of oatmeal.....mushy mushy mushy. I couldn't sleep and I believe that's the reason I was there in the first place. On our second night the used soaps were left for us and the shampoo and conditioner were not replaced. The conditioner, btw, at all Doubletree Hotels is virtually impossible to get out of the container so it's pretty useless. I would describe the hotel employees as polite and incompetent. We asked for replacement shampoo and it never came. Day two our newspaper didn't show up either. A loud humming noise in our room warranted two friendly but unhelpful visits from maintenance and the gentleman tried his best but eventually shrugged his shoulders and the humming noise continued for the duration. His equipment, btw, was substituting a wastecan for a ladder. He turned it over and stood on it. One other note, this hotel charges for inroom internet (which we never got to work anyway and wound up using the lobby's which was an enormous!!!!! walk from our room...the place is huge!!!) and $16/night for parking whereas every other place in the area provides free parking. Breakfast is also very pricey. Two bagels and coffee in the lobby were $11. without even a paper plate. Skip the Doubltree.Two night stay on way to Alaska cruise. Room was newly refurbished and very clean. Front desk helpful and the cookies delicious. Looks like an Embassy Suites with large atrium. Bed was comfortable. My only complaint was the HVAC system was not terribly accurate and I ended up opening windows to cool room off. There is an Outback and a McDonalds right outside the door. Shuttle service was very good...took it several times and only waited once for a brief time. Be sure when leaving airport that you take the right shuttle. You may need to call for it. DO NOT take the Doubletree Hotel Shuttle. This is a large bus and does not go to the Doubletree Suites!Great location with fast frequent shuttles from the airport - the hotel used by quite a few airline employees so the staff is efficient and professional. The room was very large with a nice bathroom and reasonably quiet considering it was next to the airportOnce you find youself confidently in the proper spot on the third level courtesy curb at Sea-Tac, which is no small adventure unto itself, just look for the large Doubletree bus. There is another downtown Doubletree shuttle so make sure you are on the correct shuttle! Only a short 8 minute ride put us at the hotel check in for a signature warm cookie and friendly service. I was originally assigned a ground room floor in a remote building but requested a 3rd floor/top floor room instead, preferably overlooking the onsite pond. Without a blink from the desk clerk, I got my third floor...only later did I understand it was in the tall tower staring at scaffolding that was part of the exterior stucco project occuring this April and May. I had a view of two busy streets, a parking lot and the large Northwest Airlines maintenance hangar each morning. Despite not being informed of this construction on checkin or during my reservation, the workers were of no consequence and I never heard them. I just had to keep a south window curtain pulled since the scaffolding was right....there. I was here for an intense work session anyhow and it wasn't noisy beyond what I expected for an airport hotel so I bit the bullet and kept the room. I'll get the 3rd floor pond view on another visit. I'm sure I could've pushed but just needed to get settled and get busy.
The building layout here is rather adventurous so take care to consider how far you want to be from certain features and/or activities. If you do want a view, the upper floors of the tower offer westward views across SeaTac and the Elliot Bay area. Despite the ages of the buildings, the lower structures all have a very contemporary northwest feeling to them with exposed beams and rich details throughout the complex. I found this to be very welcoming and comfortable. Keep in mind the views are limited if any from this complex.
The tower room had a corner wrap around deck but no exterior chairs to enjoy the crisp humid air. I did have a chair out for a few evening hours to enjoy the air. Since the deck above partially covered mine, it was like a room extension and the wraparound deck was enormous. Without scaffolding and workers there I'm sure it is downright enjoyable.
The room itself was large with a mixture of maple and cherry woods with contemporary shapes and accents. Upon entering the room, to the left is a full sink and closet, with the bath, toilet and another full sink further left and separated by a door. They have the nice touch of a full length mirror on this door, whcih seems to be a rarity for hotels I been in recently. The closet was generous and had plenty of hangars, an iron and ironing board. A few steps further into the room and it oepned up to the bed, a long couch, end table, coffee table, occassional chair, a full size desk and even an adjustable task chair for the desk area. The king size bed was comfortable and had 6 comfortable feather pillows. The bedside table had a phone along with the standard Hilton multi-function alarm clock. Doubletree offers a Wolfgang Puck branded coffee and tea with a special maker for you to use (but you'll have to unplug your computer to do it). The adjacent desk area was comfortable and easy to work on. My only complaint was the single outlet space on the desk shared by the coffee maker. If you have more than three items to charge or want coffee, you'll have to go looking high and low.
HVAC was electronically controlled and was easily and quickly adjusted. It was a return air system and was only a low hum. Ther return air register above the stand alone sink was furrier than a pet shop and definately needed a good vacuum and wipe down.
Each room is equipped with pay by the day or pay by the hour ethernet internet and I had no problems connecting for service. If you want to save the time or only need it for a short period, the lobby area has reliable wifi for free. I only hooked up one day of my stay and the others I used the lobby wifi for data transfers. Using a webservice you can print directly to the front desk and it will be delivered or you can pick it up. This was a huge time saver and no charge for the service. It works from both the pay accounts and the free wifi.
Decor was toward the tans, oranges, and browns in the room, and that kept a nice feeling depite the typical semi sunny and rainy weather during the stay. The room carpet was well kept with only a few stains near the coffee maker. The bathroom was roomy and clean. I still find it hard to overlook the extensive grout mold that seems to crop up at all price points only because it is not a hard fix, it just takes someone using the right material in a proper install. The complimentary nutragena bath condiments were welcome as I like that they are non-allergenic and don't leave a scent of any sort. The best part of the bathroom was the lack of noise from any other resident or function around you. The room was overall a fairly quiet place but keep in mind you are across from a busy airport and a stones throw from one of the bsuiest intersections in the region. You will hear noise and some of it will be loud enough to notice.
The features of the hotel are pretty good. The lobby restaurant is pretty good for all meals and the bar/grill could use better service but didn't get so bad as to not be able to recommend it. There is a little coffee and danish spot as well as a full service sundries shop, just be ready to pay airport prices for your purchases. The bright spots are the well appointed health clubs that serve the tower and complex. Among the nicest I've seen in the past few years.
The tower room looking west was too low to see anything but high enough not to be insulated from the road and airport noise. I'd go as as high up as possible in the tower to have the view or as far to the northeast as possible to get a room on the pond and some quiet. Everything in between will still have something in proximity - you'd do well to look at the hotel layout and talk it over with the reservation or desk clerk to get the room you really want. I""ll be back, but on that 3rd or 4th floor overlooking the pond next time.My sister and I absolutely loved this hotel. She used the hotel's complementary shuttle which was wonderful.(Especially since I was late arriving in Seattle to pick her up!) I parked my car in the hotel's parking lot. They charge $16.00+tax just to park a car each night!!! That was absolutely ridiculous since we were guests staying there for two nights. 
 The hotel was very big, nice and clean. We had a beautiful room in the ""tower"" part of the hotel. We were on the 5th floor and we loved the view and the balcony. The room was very quiet and the beds were extremely comfortable. It would have been nice and helpful to have had a microwave and a refrigerator.
 The next time that I am in Seattle I would love to stay at Doubletree Hotel again.This is the best airport hotel we have stayed in, and we have stayed there twice. It has a convenient location and a shuttle service that runs every 15 minutes for 24 hours. We had a large room with a balcony, comfortable beds, an easy chair and ottoman, and a coffee maker - all things we don't always find. We ate supper in their restaurant and I had an excellent salad (large enough to divide) and an exceptionally good Reuben sandwich. There are also other choices, with several restaurants and fast food places within a very short walk. The staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed the warm, chocolate chip cookie we were given at check-in.We recently had an overnight at the Doubletree prior to an early departure to Los Angeles. We arrived by rental car - one of the reasons we booked the Doubletree was its close proximity to the Thrifty depot. It looked close on Mapquest, and as it turns out it was about a five-minute walk. Perfect! I dropped my ""better half"" and our luggage at the hotel door - you have to get a ticket from the automatic gate to gain entry to the car park, then exit via the manned booth. If you're back out within 20 minutes, there's no charge. 
The girl at reception was fabulously friendly and efficient, and we were on our way to our room in no time (clutching a couple of warm chocolate chip cookies!). The property is quite old-fashioned, and is slowly being refurbished. Having said that, we really had no complaints with any aspect of the hotel. Our room was quiet, despite being on the ground floor, and everything was very clean and comfortable. One nice benefit was the free internet access in the business centre - much appreciated. 
As we'd had a pretty long day, we ate at the hotel's ground floor restaurant. No complaints whatsoever. Good food, good service, good pricing. After a good night's sleep, and an adequate if not spectacular room service breakfast, we caught the free shuttle to the airport terminal. All very simple.This hotel, for what they charge, is a steal for the Sea-Tac area!! Our commute down I-5 took longer than expected so we did not get to take full advantage of this hotel, but what we did was excellent! Hot cookies before we even check in was a nice treat.
Rooms are HUGE, shower hot and lots of pressure, and the bed was suberb. The best part is they have 24 hr shuttle to Sea-Tac at no cost!
We will stay here again!!Stayed at this Doubletree Jan. 1, 2008 before flying out of Seatac on the 2nd. Since it was a really cold, rainy day, we were so happy that the hotel was SO large and spread-out. We'd been visiting relatives in central WA and had felt cooped-up all week in their small house, so walking around the hotel was great! Anyway, Tripadvisor saved us the overnight parking fee, since we read about it in advance and made arrangements to turn in our rental car one day early, then take the shuttle back to the hotel. The shuttle was very convenient and on-time. We stayed on the 5th floor in the tower, and had secured a really affordable (payment in advance) rate online. We found our room very clean, and had everything we needed. The crib (a packnplay) we requested was delivered promptly too. Since we didn't want to leave the hotel with our 2 year old (it was really cold and rainy) we ate in the hotel lounge. Since we had her with us, they sat us out to the side of the actual lounge. We ordered three appetizers and a dessert, and all were excellent and beautifully served. We enjoyed our evening at this hotel, and we ran our daughter around the lobby a lot, and I also used one of the treadmills in the fitness rooms. Overall, we would give our stay a 10 plus, and will certainly use this hotel again before our yearly overnight out of Seattle when visiting my husband's family! My advice--book in advance through the Doubletree website to get a great rate, and turn in your rental early to avoid the parking fee!Stayed at this hotel beause the park n fly. Was an excellent choice, beautiful hotel and great beds made for a perfect start for
vacation. Have stayed at cheaper hotels with park n fly and they
are always scary! Pay the extra bucks for a top of line hotel with free cookies.如果你需要第二天一早从Tocoma乘飞机，这里是个非常不错的选择。在priceline上定的酒店（常常可以拍到这个），有免费的shuttle到机场。房间很大，很舒适,从房间里可以看到飞机起降，和不远处的一个pond。很多航空公司的crew住在这里。工作人员服务也很好，我们把行李寄存在了这里几天。还有，可以从机场坐shuttle去附近的mall逛逛，是打发等飞机时间的好方法。当然，你也可以做酒店的shuttle先到机场，在转那个过去。下次还会入住。Das Doubletree liegt in der Nähe des Tacoma Airports und ist mit einem regelmäßig (2x pro Stunde) verkehrenden Shuttle mit dem Terminal verbunden.
Die Zimmer selbst sind recht modern und geräumig und mit Flachbild-TV, Kaffeemaschine und allen Annehmlichkeiten ausgestattet. Das Personal ist freundlich, allerdings kann es beim Einchecken zu längeren Wartezeiten kommen, wenn gerade die Crews einchecken.
Das Hotelgebäude selbst versprüht von der Farbgebund und dem Interieur ein wenig 80er Jahre Charme, bietet aber alles in allem einen guten Preis-Leistungs-Service.le plus grand motel d'amérique du nord (800 chambres)mais divisé en plusieurs zones.On n'est pas perdue !

Parfait pour un séjour courte durée ou un transit .Gutes Hotel in der Nähe des SeaTac Flughafens in Seattle. Wir waren für zwei Nächte dort und waren sehr zufrieden. Check-in war schnell und es gab die warmen und berühmten Doubletree-Cookies. Lecker. Das Zimmer war geräumig und modern und lag in einem Seitenflügel, sodass wir unser Auto direkt davor parken konnten. Hotelseiteneingang nur mit Zimmerschlüssel betretbar.
Checkout via TV.zeer net en verzorgd hotel met prima service. enorm groot hotel dat zeer dicht bij het vliegveld ligt, zonder er overlast van te hebben.mooie grootte kamers.leuk groot buitenzwembad met bubbelbad. goed restaurant en leuke gezellige bar. zeer tevreden over ons verblijf. nadeel voor parkeren moet je weer extra betalen.Regelmässiger 24h-Shutterlservice zum Flughafen in kurzen Abständen. Gepäckaufbewahrung bereits vor der Hotelübernachtung möglich. Sehr freundliche Umgangsweise. Hotel schon etwas älter, somit nicht mehr ganz auf aktuellen modernen Stand.The room did not have a microwave or a refridgerator and for the price we paid, it should have had both. The balconies are shared, separated by a metal gate. Furniture in room was damaged and should have been replaced. There is no wireless internet in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby or the lounge. There is ""high speed internet"" in the rooms that you can plug into, but you have to pay by the hour to use it. I would certainly not stay at this hotel again. The only thing they really had to offer was a single chocolate chip cookie at check-in. I'll be spending my money more wisely elsewhere and buying my own cookies.I booked this room through Priceline, and for the price I paid ( I did a ""Name your own price"" thing~$74 incl. tax for 1 night) it was okay.....but if I had to pay the regular price I would be VERY dissapointed. I don't expect vomit in my room, and rude workers for $200+ a night,lol.
Let me start by saying I am pretty easy going, but honest. I am not someone who only points out the negatives in life~so if I sound mostly negative here, I'm sorry, but this is what stood out to me! I did mention the positives here,too.
The experience I had with my arrival was not so good. My sister dropped myself, my husband and our child off at the hotel so we could catch an early flight the next day. She literally parked, walked us to check in,went to our room (so her little girl could use the restroom) and left.....15 minutes she was there, they rudely said that she was there for 23 minutes, and only the first 20 minutes are free, then made her pay $4.00 ~credit card only, she was lucky she had one. The hotel goes for at LEAST $199 + tax per night, and they charge her $4 to drop us off? I think that is pretty outrageous.
(I read other reviewers on priceline say it's about $17/night for guests to park overnight too!! Parking should be included in the $200 a night.)
When we checked in the woman who was working the desk was unfriendly, and seemed put out that she had to check us in.
The man in the lobby who offered to help us with our bags was so nice. He made a joke with us, and was welcoming in general. 
The room itself was great! It's huge, which is helpful when you have a four year old boy with you! There was PLENTY of room for the three of us to relax in there. We also loved that there was a nice balcony and big windows. The Neutrogena products were a nice touch, as was the free cookie on arrival. They have a free airport shuttle which was handy,too.
The bathroom was very dirty though. When we lifted the toilet seat for my son to use the toilet there were large chunks and splashes of VOMIT all over the toilet. (Also the bathtub still had an old 1/2 used face wash in it,was a bit dirty and had a wet floor mat in it. That toilet though...REALLY surprised me and my little boy. It freaked him out a bit~poor guy didn't want to use that toilet again, he ended up having an 'accident' (his first ever)because he was holding off trying to go back to it. He loved the room too before we saw that!! I included some photos of the room I took while we were checking it out,
So all in all, if the service was better and the parking fees were removed I would say this hotel is wonderful. Pricey, but wonderful. The way it is now? it's not so great. I'm wondering if my experience is the norm, or if I was just very unlucky?I stayed here for a week in June, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous. The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat. A great hotel that I would happily stay again in.We stayed for 3 nights. Loved the warm cookies that they gave us upon check-in, but my hands were full of paperwork, luggage, jackets, etc. The bank of computers available were great! You can't print from any of those, but you can ask the Front Desk to get a key to the Business Center where you can print from. The spa was great as well as the bar. There was a jazz band (3 members) playing one night we stayed and they were pretty good. The concierge was fabulous! John was extremely helpful and gave us great recommendations! We would have stayed there after our cruise, but the hotel would not give us the same rate as what I had booked beforehand. We got the room for $125/night and they were quoting us $199 to add the additional night. No thanks!Good to great hotel, with a few problems. For its main market though-traveling to and from the airport-its a great option. If you have to park there it costs $18 a night and is somewhat cumbersome. It seemed silly to have a rental car there, so I turned it in at Advantage and walked the mile or so back. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, I used the 194 to get to SAFECO stadium for a meeting. It cost less than the car by far, was probably faster, and I didn't have to deal with parking downtown. The daily fee for net access is high, and WiFi is only available in the public areas of the main hotel. The hotel can get really busy, and at times the wait to talk to someone on the phone or at the front desk can take a longish time. The gym and pool are really good,for relaxing long haul flights out of your system, and the hot tub is excellent. The rooms are more than adequate, the staff attentive and the 2 concierges especially are really wonderful.If I'd paid full price for the room I would complain. Fortunately, I got the room for $60/night through Priceline. The bed was clean and comfortable. The chocolate chip cookies on check-in is a nice idea but would rather they spend more time/effort on developing a menu for room service that works. I ordered the crab cakes and a cup of the clam chowder. Campbells does a better job on the chowder and I couldn't choke down a second bite of the crab cakes. Bathroom was very clean as were the linens. Staff was friendly. We stayed in the old part of the hotel, not the newer tower, but the rooms were fine. We overlooked the lake or retention pond, whatever it is. It would have been nice if there were chairs on the balconies. Free wi-fi in the public areas was nice. I would stay there again, but not at the full rack-rate. The only real complaint is the balcony areas (stayed in 2 different rooms) - they are chock full of spider webs and the entire outside needs a good scrub. Same goes for the tired carpeting in the halls and rooms. But the for price we paid, it is a good value.Stayed one night here after coming in late, before leaving the next morning. Used points, so I don't know the regular room rate. Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport. but had some issues too. Details...
GOOD:
--Rooms, in the tower where we stayed, are pretty decent. Plenty big, nicely kept bathrooms, bed was fairly comfy.
--Rooms have a small deck, but the view is of the airport - nothing spectacular.
--Staff was friendly, both at the desk and in the restaurant.
--Location is very convenient to the airport, and pretty quick access to I-5.
--Cookies at check in were good. ;)
BAD:
--YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PARK HERE. This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking. This place had a gigantic parking lot. I think parking cost $12 or so. Ripoff.
--Restaurant staff seemed to be overwhelmed during breakfast, so they fell behind a bit. Food was good, but a bit overpriced.
--The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property.
--Common areas could be kept up better and cleaner.
--The doors to the rooms have a huge gap at the bottom - allows a lot of light and sound in from the hallway.
If you are coming late and/or leaving early at Sea-Tac, this is not a bad choice. But you may want to consider other places as well, shop around a bit.We found the Doubletree to be good for what we needed- a place to stay when our plane arrived late and we didn't want to start driving anywhere until the next day.
The airport shuttle was very good- better than other hotels I have stayed in. It seemed to ALWAYS be running, and was very convenient. We took the shuttle from the airport, and then back again to pick up our rental car (save the parking fee).
The hotel was fine- a big hotel by the airport. I didn't expect much, but some things were better than average. The view we had was of some large trees and some people's backyards- better than the parking lot for us (but I wouldn't want to live there!). The cookies are, of course, one of our favorite things about the Doubletree chain.
If I had been wanting to stay for more than one night, be close to anything interesting (other than the artificially created world of SEATAC), or wanted to get some business done, this would not have been the best hotel. But it is fine for what it is- a quick, convenient, comfortable stay by the airport.
One thing to think about- this hotel is used by a lot of conventions. When we were there, there were a bunch of real estate agents who were getting a bit rowdy. We couldn't hear them in our room (thankfully), but they were pretty loud throughout the hotel. The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas.
We did book directly on the Hilton chain website and got a rate of about $89. It looks from other reviews here like you may be able to do better on Priceline if you don't want your Hilton points.Upgraded from Priceline rate at front desk for $10/nite to king bed. I was in the wing far from the lobby like everyone describes but it wasn't that bad of a walk, this is a BIG hotel, what do you expect? Would at least make the request next time to be lakeside, it looked nice with a balcony on a lake. We were on the parking lot side, don't think it was an extra charge. Nice beds, room was quiet, a little dated in some features, e.g. popcorn ceilings, but excellent considering a priceline rate of $65. Bus stop to get to downtown RIGHT outside the hotel, takes about 25 minutes via bus for $1.50.I stayed here for a conference at the end of July, and was pleasantly surprised. This is a typical Doubletree Hotel--great cookies, comfy beds, nice business hotel but not especially luxurious. It lived up to my expectations, but also exceeded them in some ways, such as...
-I came to Seattle a few days before my conference and stayed at a hotel downtown because I thought it would be virtually impossible to stay at this hotel and see the sights of Seattle. I was wrong. The city bus stops right in front of the hotel, and for less than $2 (unless it's rush hour), you're downtown in about 25 minutes. I did appreciate the convenience of my downtown hotel after long days of being a tourist, but had I known how easy transportation would be, I may have stayed here the whole time.
-They make getting to and from the airport super easy and super speedy. The free shuttle runs every 15 minutes--a much better option than the $40 cab ride to my downtown hotel from the airport! 
-The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. They even have a shuttle that takes you to a nearby shopping mall for when you're too tired to hike into the city. :) (Although I do not recommend eating at the Rainforest Cafe at this mall... yuck. The Nordstrom, however, had great selection. :) )
-The pool is heated! I didn't bring a swimsuit, because I didn't expect the weather to be conducive to swimming, but why not, if the water's warm? So bring your suit!
Others are correct that you may get a room that's a bit of a hike from the front desk, but hopefully you only have to make the trip with luggage twice (upon check in and check out), and it's tolerable. 
Also, several people have complained about the parking fee. Just keep in mind, this is Seattle--it's expensive no matter where you go.The DoubleTree was convenient to the airport, even though we were part of group travel, the DoubleTree had an airport shuttle. This is a multi story well thought out hotel. There were elevators, gift shop, restaurant and lots of other dining choices just across the street. You could safely cross the street at the light and crosswalk and find your self at a diner or several other restaurants. The hotel staff was courteous and very helpful with our questions. Our room was large and very comfortable. Even though we were there for just one night we would recommend this hotel for multiple night say if you are visiting the Seattle, WA area. We cannot comment on the value, as our price was included in our group travel, so Iwe're sure it was a group or discounted rate.Last night Saturday July 11, 2009, we drove down to seattle and checked into doubletree hotel near the seattle airport to escape our 30 degree celcius hot temperature here in vancouver, canada. When we arrived at around 10pm last night we managed to park our car far away because the most immediate parking spots are valet parking only.
We have to drive through a ticket gate to enter the public parking, we asked the hotel check in clerk if there's a charge for parking at their hotel they said yes $16 plus taxes because it's location is next to the airport.
If i knew ahead of time i would never stay at their hotel, i wasn't happy paying that extra fee because other hotels such as Hyatt at downtown Bellevue on weekend you don't need to pay for parking and they are higher in class.
Inside our hotel room wasn't impressive at all, first thing i always check is the bed to see if it's clean and i found two black and yellow stains in the middle of one of the queen beds ewww. i complain to my husband about it but of course he already paid on the internet for this hotel stay so really we couldn't just walk away and go to another.
The washroom is not as clean as it should be such that the countertops are not wipe clean properly and the glasses to be used to rinse up after brushing your teeth has residue on it. For a two queen hotel room they have only three bath towels to use...wow,
The newspaper that you'll find outside your hotelroom the next morning, they already charged that price onto your hotel bill which is (Mon-Sat = $0.25 Sun=$0.75).
The only good thing my kids like about this hotel is that they have a flat screen tv to watch cartoon.We had the penthouse suite, 2 rooms with a kitchenette. The shuttle getting from the airport to the hotel was very croweded and hot (yes hot for Seattle) and smelled. We had planned to eat at the hotel restaurant but it was not open. So we had to order a pizza. Strange for such a large hotel not to have a restaurant or two. They told us to go across the street. They did have warm cookies at check-in. The room was done up in buttery soft yellows. The bathroom was huge. Larger then some hotel rooms I've stayed in. It had a sunken in tub, huge walk-in shower, robes & full line of Neutrogena beauty products. Two flat screen TV's-sitting room w/ leather sofa, tables and chairs.
There was a huge wrap around balcony with a view of the glass elavators and a view of the Cascade Mts. The bed was so comfy I slept like a baby. The room was very sound prrof, as I did not hear anyone in the halls or other rooms. No b-fast was offered. The shuttle only runs on the hour, not every half an hour like you would assume from an airport hotel. So we almost missed our flight. By the time the shuttle was prepared to leave on the hour there were to many people to fit in the shuttle(they could have run there & back in that time ). The shuttle was hot and smelly again and people were mad.
If you are not using the airport shuttle this hotel is great.We stayed only 1 night prior to flying out the next night. The reception kindly let us extend our room to 3pm without any charge. The room was enormous with two queen beds, lots of pillows and comfy mattressses. The bathroom was also huge and very modern with lots of marble. We asked for a room nearer to the lobby so we did not have to trek too far, as warned by a previous reviewer. There was free internet access and also a printer to print your boarding pass, which we made use of. We did not patronise the restaurant/bar as we found a few chain eateries around the neighborhood for our breakfast and lunch. All in all very good airport hotel and certainly value for money as we got it at $50 through bidding on priceline.com.We paid $69 for the room through Hotwire and were thrilled with the value. The rooms are very large with a very nice bathroom layout. The bathrooms have granite counterops and are loaded with extra amenities such as facial cleanser. The beds were comfy and the pillows were great. The bar/restuarant was suprisingly good. I went in with low expectations and the restauarant was actually astonishingly good. An earlier review mentioned lack of free wireless internet. This appears to have changed and we did have free wireless. This is the best Doubletree I believe I have stayed in. We were catching a flight out early the next morning at Seatac, and this was a great choice. I would absolutely recommend this hotel and would stay again. Frankly, even if the price doubled this would be a good deal and a great place to stay.PL room - upgraded at check in. Great friendly staff and a nice large room but somewhat dated. Good location.Bought our stay here on Priceline. Got a good deal $45 for the night. It is hard to find fault at that price, and I won't. But although the room was huge and lavish with two large queens, it was not a place I enjoyed. Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat. No frig or microwaves in Doubletree hotels, too many pillows on the bed. The room had a large balcony overlooking a lake and on the 4th floor we were up in the trees. Despite the low rate, the receptionist tried to give us the type of room I wanted (high floor, one bed) and was very pleasant to me. A beautiful hotel for other types of travelers - groups, business people, etc. For those using the hotel to fly there are shuttles, flight info, and a kiosk to print out boarding passes (although it did not work for me). Just too too big for a one night stay, but a lovely hotel after all.We travel through Seattle a lot, and this is by far the best airport hotel that we have every stayed at (especially for the price). The room was very large, the bedding was comfortable and the showerhead was awesome. The shuttle to the airport leaves every 20 minutes, and it can be quite full.Hotel room was just fine for a one night stay before departing on our vacation. Rooms were decent and clean. Used priceline.com and got an excellent deal. Loved the warm cookies they give you at check in! No problems. Note: They do charge a parking fee of about $17-18 per night on top of the room charge. If you arrange parking in advance on the internet at one of the Airport Parking Lots (We used Extra), it's only $4 - 6/night. Solid 3 star hotel.My husband and I have stayed here most recently in April. We love the property. The beds are sooo comfortable and the staff is always outstanding!"

The staff are great and the local restuarant is excellent.
Secure parking is a plus. Free wi-fi - my only issue was waking at 4 am to do a conference call and I could not find the internet password - called down to the front desk and the man on duty would not give it to me - he insisited I come down to get it in person - I tried to convince him that at 4 am I was not dressed but he claimed it was policy that guests come down to collect the password at the desk ....so I got dressed and went downstairs to get it.
Ridiculous and I was seriously irritated ! 
Anyway I spoke with the day staff and they seemed shocked - that is not hotel policy! 
Keep the code safe!We had been intending to see ""King Tutankhamen's Treasures"" at the Pacific Science Center before it leaves in January. Time was getting short, so we decided we better purchase VIP tickets so we wouldn't have to go at a specific time, and/or stand in line. We opted for this hotel due to it's proximity to the Seattle Center, and we were not dissapointed. From the secure underground parking, to the Space Needle view King room, we were pleased. The hotel is a bit older, but well kept, and has been updated furniture wise as well. Our room was an ""adjoining"" room, and the group next door was a bit Loud - I don't think the doors are thick enough or sound proof enough between the two rooms.The Hotel staff were very efficient, and helpful. Our package came with free breakfasts at ""Brella's"" restaurant inside the hotel. We should have passed on that. The breakfast was nothing to write home about. We have had much better breakfasts at other hotels that were included in the cost of the room. I feel sorry for the people who were paying for the breakfast on top of the cost of the room. The offerings were not much different that other hotels, but they were not good. Sausages were slimy, eggs were very stiff and dry, hash browns were slimy too. The only good thing were the Waffles that are made hot on the spot. We were blessed with decent weather, and another surprise at the Seattle Center, the Dale Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibit that has just been added this year. We arrived about 4:00pm, so we saw the garden with a bit of sunlight left, then experienced it after dark. FANTASTIC!This hotel has excellent location. I would recommend the space needle view, however not at the end of the hallway, you will get a very small window. They only offer a free breakfast buffet for best western members otherwise you will pay 7.95. Good buffet and excellent seating vs other Best Westerns. Rooms are nice for what you pay and very resonable compared to other lodging closer to downtown. You are walking distant to the monorail which takes you to downtown. However if you plan on driving around you may want to look for another location as parking is very limited if anything is going on in Seattle and you may find yourself with street parking blocks away! We left one night and parking was full, the counter personnel suggested a lot two blocks down that charged 10.00 for 10 hours. We were not happy campers and if you have walking issues this defiantly would not have worked out well for accommodations. Walls are thin and unless you turn on the heater you feel like your sleeping with 2 sheets and a very light blanket we had to pull from the closet. I wouldn't suggest the hotel restaurant as the front desk steered us to better food.My husband and I stayed there on Saturday and would recommend it to others! The staff was very friendly, very quiet and relaxing, our room was clean and the beds very comfortable! Good for the price. Very close to the Space Needle. We would definately stay there again next time we go to Seattle. Overall great hotel!We have been dong quite a bit of traveling since we retired at the end of July. The Best Wester Plus Executive Inn is one of our favorites. Staff's attitude is ""what can we do to make your stay a great experience.it was overall a great hotel.the location was the best I've seen.very clean and great parking.Which they had under ground too.my one big complaint was the Internet, in would ask me to put the password after every time I left and came back.once I was connected the internet was very slow.when I tryed to connect on my laptop it wouldent work! After I went to the lobby to ask why and they told me to call a number.they would not answer no matter what time of day.i over all recommend this hotel, but keep good Internet out of your mind,Had a wonderful time thanks to the very helpful staff. Te were great in giving us directions & advise as to where to go & how to get there in Seattle. Awesome location!! Great view!!! Rooms were clean & well stocked. Wifi was flawless.A short one night stay here was just average. There was nothing to complain about but nothing to brag about either. I did feel that the ""Plus"" status of the hotel was a marketing stretch.
I do give credit to this property for location location location. It is an easy walk to many Seattle attractions around the space needle.Reserved in July for 2 occupancy room of 2 queen beds (traveling with adult son) in November for a concert at Key Arena. The only good thing I can say is that it was close and handy to the concert. Arrived to check in and was told they had no rooms with 2 beds and we will have a roll-away sent up ( saddest bed you ever saw and delivered by a rude housekeeper that acted mad that he had to bring us a bed and extra blanket and pillows...didn't even offer to set the bed up!!) Room was 2nd floor by elevator (noisy setting as you heard all guests and housekeepers coming and going) View was of roof top of neighboring building and lower parking area.
No good places nearby to eat at after 10pm.
Had a nice shower with lots of water pressure though the tub wouldn't drain.We stayed here for 3 nights as we went to the Rush concert at the Key Arena (excellent concert, by the way). The location was perfect (contrary to other reviews, we did not have trouble finding this) and we had an excellent view of the space needle from our 4th floor room. Yes, it's an older hotel in need of some renos, and I understand they are working on it. The room had plenty of space and everything worked well. Our main issue was the noise coming from the guests next door - one night is was a child being loud and the next someone was talking loud until about 2 in the morning. This may have been because it was an adjoining room (so next time I would request a room that does not have a connecting door - lesson learned there). The breakfast was better than many you get in Best Westerns - and there is plenty of choice so as not to get bored over a few days' stay. The food in the restaurant in the evening was rather bland so we only ate there once. 
It is nice to have a fridge and microwave in the room as I always ask for a fridge at least. 
The staff at the hotel were always polite and friendly even when they had a line up of guests waiting to be seen. I am also impressed that the manager sees and responds to all of these reviews, so no doubt he will comment below. 
Some suggestions for the future in a BW Plus: have proper glasses and mugs as well as the disposable options (I have seen the reports of how these are cleaned in some places, so guests can wash their own). Also, think about advising guests if their room has a connecting door to the next room, so we can decide whether to stay in that room or not.The hotel is in a great location, with views of the space needle and within easy walking distance of the monorail to downtown. The service was patchy, however, and the lobby and rooms were a little dingy and in need of modernization, particularly in view of the price. Parking is $15 but for an extra $5 you can also get a rate that includes breakfast, although the breakfast is nothing special. The bar has a nice selection of locally-brewed ales on tap.The front desk was helpful, credit card mess for parking! But they ended up not charging me. McDonald's right around the corner made to go breakfast cheap and easy, tho I did eat once at the hotel, not badWe wanted a place close to the museums and attractions near the Space Needle and took advantage of the hotel's King Tut package. The hotel is literally two blocks from everything and the price was better than others we checked out online. We parked our car at the hotel and did not have to move it for the entire time we were there (3 nights). 
One of the big advantages to staying here for the King Tut package is that it gave us VIP tickets, which meant we could go see the exhibit any time it was open, rather than have a date and time specific ticket.
The motel room was clean and adequate, but we didn't spend much time in it. The view from our room was pretty blah - overlooking a parking lot, except we did get to watch one of those really big building cranes in operation. Be aware that at least this part of Seattle seemed to be in construction mode. It was not the hotel's fault, but we were awakened at 7 AM one morning by non-stop jack-hammering in the street and even earlier a second morning by the arrival of the garbage truck.
On the plus side, the room had a refrigerator, microwave, and an arm chairm but the bathroom was TINY. (Don't try to sit on the toilet and close the door all at the same time!). 
Can't comment on the maid service other than to say that they did respect our privacy and did not clean the room since we put out the ""do not disturb"" sign. They did leave us a note each day telling us that if we did want anything serviced to just let the front desk know, which I thought was a nice way to handle it.
We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant each morning for the convenience and because the first day it was part of the package. There was a good variety, from make-your-own breakfast burrito or waffle to oatmeal, bacon, etc. -- although it was the same exact choices each day, which got a little boring by the third morning. Breakfast was about $8, 
We had family stay at another hotel in the area earlier in the year and they were surprised it did not have air conditioning. This hotel did have air conditioning and it worked fine.
Again, definitely an adequate place, reasonable price (for Seattle), and super location.Stayed for three nights and enjoyed every moment of it. Room, location, helpful staff, cleanliness, value and comfort everything was spot on. Staff was friendly and helpful So Highly recommended and will return.I wanted a hotel near the Space Needle because I knew traffic would be a nite mare, it was. Trying to find this place was hard. Check in at 5:00 was horrific, only 1 person there, come on really, took 45 minutes and after a 9 hour drive that was beyond comprehension. We got lucky and got a room with a view without having to pay the extra $20.00 a night for it so that helped a little bit. The halls and rooms were dirty and the beds oh my goodness, how horrible they were, so uncomfortable, my son said ""felt like a really big person slept on it and they need replaced the springs are totally broken""... Not pleased at all. Then the breakfast for 3 days that we paid $7.95 each day did change AT ALL!! And they closed it at exactly 10:00 a.m., no exceptions. We were there from Mon afternoon through Thurs. I put in a complaint card, and got an e-mail response which I replied back to but nothing further, but not sure that management will do anything. For the $890.00 for 3 nights (almost my mortgage payment) I thought it would have been better rooms than that. Won't ever do that again, was worried about the next night as it was a Best Western in Portland.......Stayed in Seattle for one night. Wanted to do touristy things such as the space needle and pike market. Space needs was steps away and right outside our window (deff spend a little extra for the space needle view!) and pike market was just about a mile... We walked, great restaurants on the way. Staff was friendly. Overall good experience. Don't recommend the morning buffet, not worth $7.Let's see...We checked into the Best Western Executive as part of the Blackball Ferry package. The hotel was old with carpet stains and looked to be under some kind of construction - the baseboards were missing, walls were grungy, etc. We asked at the front desk for transportation to and from Safeco field to watch the Mariner's game (the Mariners won by the way). We were informed that we could take a shuttle from the hotel and to call for a pick up on our way back. After the game, we walked back to the drop off location and called the phone number provided. We were rudely informed to 'Take a Taxi'!!! I called the number from a different phone and the jerk who answered it said that the company I reached wasn't there and he hung up. I verified that I had indeed called the correct number and was by now truly ticked off. Thank goodness for the kind driver from the Travel Lodge (where we will be staying when we come back to Seattle) who said that she would drop us off at the hotel for half the price for getting to the game. I reported the issue back at the front desk (the jerk who apparently answered the phone was there). I told them that 'I wasn't amused at being deserted in Seattle at 10:30 at night by their 'shuttle service'. The staff ignored me so I am giving my review here and will also be sending a letter to the company because this behaviour is NOT acceptable. I will also be advising everyone I know to NOT staying at this hotel but to try the Travel Lodge; apparently they have a grasp of good service. Bad on you Best Western - very bad!!! Oh, and the room was also very noisy - not the other customers, just the building itself.i made a reservation thru hotels.com and when i got to the hotel the man ""Julian Gomez"" at the front desk said he didn't have it , ""sorry, i can check you in but you have to pay in full again ! "" , i was very dissapointed as i had showed him my confirmation voucher from hotels.com and clearly said my reservation was paid in full, he completely disregarded the voucher and said ""you should call hotels.com to solve the problem"" , i responded it is your job to find the solution, i am the customer holding a voucher that says i have a fully paid reservation at this hotel and you should call hotels.com to solve the problem, he was clearly unhappy and unwilling to help.. i have to say it is the most expensive best western hotel i have every stayed at and it has the worse customer service of all , accomodations are ok and the location is excellent, thanks to ""Julian"" the front desk manager my experience was overall bad, tip to manager:send Julian to a customer service crash course asap.....Great location, close to Pacific Science Center, Space Needle, Ride the Ducks, Chulily Glass Garden. It's an easy short walk to these attractions and the monorail station takes you downtown to Pike Place Market. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms are spacious and clean, and the $15 a day parking fee is very reasonable. 
Dining Tip: There are not a lot of restaurant choices nearby and we didn't want to eat at the hotel's restaurant, so we walked over the the space needle and discovered The Collections restaurant right beside the Chuhily glass garden. What a find! Great menu reasonably priced and lots to chose from. We loved it so much we went there twice. They have lots of appetizers and small entree items. You will really enjoy the collections that are displayed inside each table.We reserved over 20 rooms at this hotel. Since the wedding was at the Space Needle, we asked for rooms with views of the needle. All the rooms were perfect! We had brunch for 50 of our out of town guests the following day and it was fabulous. The set up was great and the food was super! Patricia was an excellent help in making decisions and was so supportive. Great place to stay and have an event.We stayed in the BW Plus pre and post cruise. What made this special for my group was the location, location, location, and the wonderful staff who made our stay enjoyable. Special kudos goes to the front desk of Kelly and Alex who made our arrangements of transports easy and streefree, our rooms ready and very clean, and most of all the above and beyond helpfulness. Thank you Staff!Good location but busy check in desk. Secure parking is nice but is meant for small cars. Rooms have fridge but not much view. Good access to transit and space needle. A pool would have been nice but we weren't in the rom much anyway.Don't judge by the outside appearance. Clean rooms and great service. Space needle and all Seattle central within one block. Monorail is also a block away. Plan on staying here many times while heading out on Alaska cruise. Cannot wait to come back!nice hotel,very clean and help always available depending on your needs.space needle across the way plus monorail taking you into the city.breakfast was a variety and theres a mcdonalds round the corner if you fancy something different.(i did yummy),i never used the swimming pool or spa but they looked good so ive just gave a rating on look....although the hotel is in a good place for getting to attractions the area is not 100%.there are homeless around now and then but you dont really get bothered..although our car was parked in the hotel it was nice to witness traffic police taking all matters into consideration and not just splashing out tickets,..first time ive witnessed that and so a credit to their city...you should not be disapointed staying here.The hotel is at great location. Many of the Seattle attractions are stone throw away. We reached in the afternoon and there were already many people waiting for early check-ins. The front desk was very polite and helpful. They told us that though it will take sometime to prepare the room (as I mentioned we were well before check-in time), they can hold our luggage so that we can spend our time as we want.
The room was clean with nice views of space needle. Breakfast is paid and to me seems fine not very good. Monorail is one block away and we used it for our travel to downtown. I have 3 tips for people traveling with kids
1. They have very nice but limited cookies in the evening (around 5PM) which kids will really love.
2. If you plan to go to the waterfront and you don't have a car, walk to junction of 1st Ave & cedar ct (4 blocks away) and take bus 99 to travel free to any of the waterfront attraction.
3. There is a Wallgreens close to hotel for basic kids needs like Milk, snack, water etc. For short cut use ally near hotel parking.The location is perfect- it is close to everything.Easy access to the monorail. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly. Good breakfast. When we returned a week later after our cruise the F/D was kind enough to hold our luggage until our flight. THANK you!!!!!!!This is a ok hotel. Solid and acceptible, but wont knock your socks off.
As for the pluses, its location is great, right near the space needle and the whole park there and monorail, so easy to get where you need. In a way, all you have to do is jump on the monorail to get to pike place without place without having to stay at a real expensive hotel there.
Staff were VERY VERY friendly and helpful, almost too much. Everyone wanted to help us find things and had advice on where to go etc...THey really went the extra mile
Rooms were standard, nothing special. Bathroom was abit dated. Big thing was the bath tube has some nasty dirt in it, we told the staff and they were going to attend to it, but we left (stayed only 1 night) so dont know how it happned.
Free wifi which is a definite plus, although it was kinda slow (as many free networks are today)This is a fine property, although expensive, if you are attending events at Seattle Center. It is a short walk to the Space Needle and surrounds and a relatively easy walk downtown. If you aren't into walking, the Monorail is near by. The hotel provides clean rooms, a hot breakfast and parking (although I think the breakfast and parking is not always included in the price of the room). The staff were friendly and responsive to questions. This is not a five star property but convenient and pleasant.We made our reservations probably 9 months in advance and got what we felt was a great rate for Seattle. This hotel was in a great location for our family of 4 (including teenage sons). We enjoyed the location next to the Space Needle (probably the closest hotel to the Space Needle). We had a great view and were within walking distance for everything we needed including a short walk to Kerry Park (1.5 miles) and 2 grocery stores. If you want to go downtown to Pikes Peak or into the shopping district, the tram is within site of the hotel and within minutes of it -- a walk to downtown took us about 20-30 minutes but it was nice weather. 
The front desk staff was accomodating to our requests. ALEX in particular was the most helpful, making suggestions for us to make our stay more enjoyable, so if you see him at the front counter, I am confident your stay will be enjoyable. We were booked in Room 8111 which was perfect with a great Space Needle view. The room itself was perfectly fine, plenty of room, air conditioning, and bathroom accommodations. Internet connectivity in the room was a bit spotty, so we just used the 3 computers provided downstairs. 
We ate breakfast twice at the hotel which was fine as well. It is a hotel in a big city, so you will have ""big city"" things around the hotel -- homeless people, beggars and the party goers.I have to be completely honest about things here. First of all, the location is desirable because it's walking distance (only about a block and a half) from the ""Seattle Center"" with its attractions like the Space Needle, Children's Museum, Pacific Science Center, EMP museum, and Chihuly Glass Museum. However, the neighborhood needs some clean-up. There is a grey building located kitty-corner from the hotel. This building is completely closed up and has white spray-painted graffiti covering the entire building. There are a few homeless people living in the doorways of that building, so it doesn't make the area around the hotel feel very safe. As we walked to the Seattle Center one Saturday afternoon, there were also women a block away from the hotel advertising to drivers to visit the ""Hottie Car Wash."" These women were wearing skimpy bikinis, fishnet stockings, and extremely high heeled shoes. I'm sorry to say that they looked more like prostitutes, and we had our 5 and 8-year-old children in tow with us, and the kids started asking all kinds of questions as we tried to usher them as far from these women as possible.
 As I said in my title, I have higher expectations for a hotel that has ""Plus Executive"" in its name. We stayed at a ""Best Western PLUS"" and a regular ""Best Western"" in Yakima, WA and Astoria, OR on this same trip, and both of those hotels were in far better condition and far better managed than this one was. In addition to this, we paid at least twice the amount for a room here in Seattle than at the one in Yakima--although to be somewhat expected, given the location. The computers in this hotel were super slow and internet connections were poor. The breakfast, which wasn't even included in the price of the hotel--unlike the other 2 Best Westerns I stayed in, was mediocre. (You can go down the block to McDonald's for less money and same quality of food).
 The sleep quality was fine. But we had a broken window in our room that no one seemed to notice before I brought it to their attention. There was a 3-inch crack in the glass and the lock was missing from the window. There were no screens on the window, so I would have been afraid of one of my kids throwing things out of the window onto the street below. We did, however, have a fabulous view of the Space Needle.
 There is no swimming pool at this hotel, which may be part of the reason why some of the other hotels may be priced a bit higher. But again, if you're going to pay for a ""Full Service"" hotel, you might expect it to have a swimming pool.I got really lucky finding this hotel at the price I did. It's a very nice hotel in a great location. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are modern and clean. I wouldn't recommend paying for the breakfast at the hotel. Save the money for a better place. The best thing about the hotel is that it's across the street from the Space Needle and the monorail that takes you to Pike's Place.We stayed here two nights. The rooms are good, air conditioning good, bathroom all good, location good right next to Space Needle and Seattle Center unless you would prefer to be closer to the Pike Place Market because its a long walk from this hotel. 
Anyway the reason we would never stay here again is because of the front desk service which was terrible. We asked them to call us a taxi and they said it would be ready in 10 minutes so we go down in 10 minutes only to find that nobody called the taxi, so we need to make another call and wait. This happened again when we called the previous night to ensure a taxi would be there at 6am for an early train ride we booked. When the time came we were told there was no record of the taxi request so no taxi was waiting for us. We had checked with them three times to ensure this booking was made but still it was not.
There was one guy working on the front desk who was pretty good, the rest were not very friendly and gave bad service. Also, if you want to spend most time in the city and Pikes Place, try a closer hotel.Stayed one night to find that the room was below expectation. 2 queen size beds - beds were okay but bedsheets were thin and old and of rather cheap quality. The blanket was a thin one which feels very rough (not the soft plushy kind). Room could use some updating in terms of carpet, light switches, etc.. Safe did not work. Bathroom looks very 80s and outdated. Fan inside bathroom does not work and hence after a shower, the bathroom feels very moist and stuffy. Sink sits outside of bathroom. No bath mat in the bathroom. No toiletries such as lotion, shower caps, etc.. Worst of all, the air-conditioning system is very weak. It fails to cool the room even though it's already turned to its highest. Overall, rather disappointing room. Positives: location of hotel is only two blocks away from the Space Needle and Monorail. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.They could not have been more accommodating to us. They gave us a view of the space needle and it is within a very short walk to the needle and everything around it which is extensive. We hardly had to touch the car while were there. You do have to pay 7.95 for breakfast but if you have children they eat free. It was still worth it even with the breakfast cost.Check in was 4pm. We arrived at 1pm after travelling for 18 hours and arrangements were made so we could get straight in our room. My sons loved the view of the Space Needle from our window. Staff were very helpful giving directions and maps. The buffet breakfast was excellent and had lactose free items! Interesting customers included Avatar characters and clowns! The room was clean and tidy. Would stay there again without hesitation.A bit off the beaten track, but close to Downtown and the Seattle Center is almost across the street. The rooms are clean, and bright and the hotel is far enough off Denny Way that traffic noise isn't that bothersome. South Lake Union, Queen Anne, Belltown, Pike Market and Downtown are all walkable from here. The EMP, Key Arena and Space Needle are 5 minutes away.
We stopped in on the way north from Portland and I was pleased to see that there was some latitude on the room rates even as a walk-in. Seattle is an expensive place to stay, so it's nice to see that good deals can still be had.Recently stayed here before an Alaskan cruise out of Seattle. When checking prices was shocked at how expensive the Seattle area is. Got this hotel on a travel site at a pretty good rate. Upon checkin we were pleasently surprised at what a nice hotel this is. It was not overly fancy but it was clean, great service, and a little more upscale than what we expected. Front desk people were very friendly and helpful. We would definatly stay here again.Service was friendly and good when we had their attention. When I worked in the service industry we were taught not to answer the phone or to put the phone customer on hold because the customer in front of you is the most important one - Some of the staff we talked to would answer the phone and have conversations about reservations and stuff while I was in mid-convo with them. Not cool. 
I also do find it a bit off putting that some of the staff do not have any knowledge of the area. As staff working in the tourism industry, I feel they should at least have maps on hand or direct us to some good pamphlets when asked a question, or direct to another staff member who may be more helpful. Regardless of whether you are new to Seattle or not, that is your job, not mine.
What is the Seattle tourism charge going towards? Maybe it should be for training the staff to be more tourist friendly. Maybe basic training/knowledge info on what's in the area would be good.
Also, before showing up, we had a bit of a run-around making the reservation. We were here for the King Tut Package and it seemed their call centre did not know much about it. It was a little frustrating. After we booked and asked for email confirmation we did not get it until we called back a few times because they mis-heard our email more than once and did not confirm it properly. This I find is also a little unacceptable.
When we asked for the price for an extra night (Sunday night) they quoted us about $40 over the price of our package deal even with BCAA discount, which we thought was a little ridiculous. If that's the normal rate, this hotel is not a good deal at all. Our package rate was $169 including free parking and breakfast. Upon checkout there was that extra tourism fee that no one told us about, and the taxes were a little different from what was emailed to us maybe due to that extra fee.
We also notice that our points were not added on so now we will have to call the service centre again and ask what happened. All this extra calling and needing to run after things like points makes me not impressed with the disorder of it all.
The room itself was clean and decent. The bathroom fan is very weak. There were 2 beds. One had a better mattress than the other in that I could feel the other one had really well used springs. The pillows were way too huge for my taste. I asked if they had other size ones at the front desk and they said no. Fridge, microwave, coffee machine, flat screen TV, and an excellent view of the Space Needle and EMP Museum in our 3rd floor room. For a place that is so central, I am also pleased to note that there was not a lot of outside noise in the room.
Free breakfast with our package was excellent. This is probably one of the better hotel breakfasts (in this level of hotel) for me simply because they had a lot of gluten free choices and some healthier alternatives such as cottage cheese and salsa, beans, and rice. They also had a waffle maker, fruit, cereals, bacon, potato fries, (fake/powdered?) scramble eggs, milk, juices, and coffee. Very good selection. The coffee is not good.
Free parking was also included in our package which is nice too (normally $15). And also they allowed us to park until 4pm even though checkout is 11am.
I would say the best part of the hotel is the location which is excellent - stone's throw to Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Centre ... easy walk to Pike Place Market and Piers. Lots nearby and very convenient.
I feel the location, free breakfast and parking, and decent room makes this hotel good enough for the price we paid.
PS. A bonus for us was all the weird people who apparently like to use this hotel. The when we arrived, there was a group of people dressed as the Na'vi people of Avatar, and when we checked out there was a clown convention going on and we saw tons of clowns. Good fun to be had! (=Stayed July 4th. Our experience with front desk staff was very good. They took time to do things I found staff at other BWs didn't (e.g phone other hotels to confirm reservations). Sure, the premise looks dated (new carpet in halls would be a start), but the rooms were decent. Had a good night's sleep (my wife is a light sleeper), and had a nice complimentary breakfast. Walking to Pike's Market is not impossible, and the nearby Zeek's Pizza is very good. For those interested in the Needle, it is a couple of blocks away.Found this hotel to be very old and rundown in some parts. They are working on upgrades but the hallways are frightening. Rooms are large and clean at least but carpet could use a cleaning. Can hear others in their rooms. Beds have no duvets, just a regular hotel blanket between two sheets so if you keep the air on or window open you get cold. Had to park out front and Security told us he can't watch everything so to remove valuables. Made us a bit nervous. Would not be my first choice next time but I have seen worse.I helped organize a small convention (50 people) using this as the group hotel. In addition to a block of hotel rooms, we made use of meeting rooms and banquet services.
The hotel rooms were pretty decent. Your standard hotel room; clean, quiet, spacious, still never enough power outlets next to the bed... A HDTV, Microwave and Fridge in every room was a very nice thing. The water pressure in my room seemed pretty high, you had to be careful when turning on the tap to avoid spray. View was nice, right out at the Space Needle and the EMP Museum from our room on the west side of the building. Rooms where nice and quiet with decent acoustical separation.
The elevators are quirky, which was a little frustrating at times as much as we used them. For a regular stay this wouldn't be an issue, but going up and down many times a day made it a little annoying if there was a long wait. Stair access between the rooms and the lobby would have solved this issue, but was not available.
The meeting rooms where nice and decently equipped. They weren't ""cheap"" if all you needed was a space; but they came will equipped with our requested furniture and great staff support for last minute changes. Audio options for presentations were a little limited - connecting a laptop into the room speakers was a only minor challenge for myself as a broadcast engineer with an appropriate adapter, but it was a long way from plug-and-play.
We had a banquet at the hotel our last night; and for a very reasonable price we had a *delicious* meal with plenty of food and a room set up in style with ample ""wow factor"" for our attendees. The staff was extremely accommodating with our wide variety of special dietary requests and our uncertain numbers leading up to the event.
Overall it was a well suited place to host a small event; with very helpful staff in all departments who were quick to respond to our every need, despite the slightly aging facility. The prices were a little on the high side for some things for a low budget group; but given the fantastic location (half a block from the Space Needle, EMP Museum, and Seattle Center; short walk or monorail ride into down town, fast access from I5 when the traffic was co-operating) it was a very good deal all around.
I would not hesitate to host another event in this hotel.The hotel from the outside is hideous and the corridors are like those in the Coen brother's Barton Fink. Luckily the rooms are spacious, and the beds are comfy. But the rooms though big are a little airless. And the shower is diabolical - its controls are really difficult to manipulate and there was no hot water at 8.45 am and it never came back until the evening. The desk staff are friendly and very helpful though. In fact the desk clerk who suggested eating at the 5 Spot when we arrived at 11pm starving, deserves commendation. It is a great diner especially very late in the evening with an excellent range of local boutique beer! It is also 2 minutes from the monorail.While during my stay July 14-15 2012, I experienced an emergency where I had to get in touch with my daughter. At the time, a gentleman by the name of Tom was covering the desk, as the night manager, Ken, was off the property. Tom was excellent!!!!!!!! He went above and beyond trying to help me connect with my daughter. Even though I don't think he normally works the front desk, he did all he could do to help me. He was upbeat, concerned and very attentive to my needs. Once Ken came back, he took over from Tom and was so unhelpful and uncaring it took me by surprise as Tom had been so good. Ken had, to say the least, a sour disposition, never once did I see him smile, was unhelpful, was "" to busy"" to assist me.
The mornign of the fifteenth, when I went to breakfast, I was waiting to be seated. I was by myself, waiting, than, two more parties came after me. The woman seeting people, I believe her name might be Dana, bypassed me and seated the other two parties first. Now, I don't want to believe this could happen in this day and age, but it did make me think as the other two parties this waitress sat were of the same ethnic group as she. Felt like discrimination. Perception after all, is the reality. On the morning of the fifteenth, as I was checking out, a young man by the name of Justin was such a breath of fresh air compared to my dealings with Ken the previous evening. Justin was helpful, smiling, fun, humorous and a joy to work with. You really need to take a hard look at Ken as he does not represent your companay as I assume you would want him to. Thank you for the opportunity to review my stay.I have stayed at my share of Best Westerns, and for a chain they did ok by me.. but now I need to regroup after this place.
I always like quiet rooms, so they put me on the same side as the building that's being demolitioned. They put me in a room where the garbage bins are under my window. And yes, there is ""that"" room. Oh, and they put me next to the elevator. I asked for this months ago.
Now for the negatives :
windows, rug all need updating. Rug had stains.
They've got the supposed green items, more like greenwashing. Things like a dispenser for unnamed shampoo/conditioner/lotion.
Location was kind of hidden in the bowels of Seattle despite the Space Needle's closeness. 
Paid way, way too much for this hotel.
Now to the positives: 
Staff though clueless about their whereabouts/location were ""nice"" enough.
The loud noise of the old a/c drowned out the sounds from outside.
The housekeeping staff seemed to be doing a great job despite what they were stuck working with.
Cheap flat tv screen - (I think I would have preferred an antique tv to match the surroundings.)
A remote that is supposed to keep you from getting germs? How much money did they have to pay to install that feature?
Wifi (FREE, and it actually was fast) (Ah, there's the REAL plus factor)
15.00 only parking fee. Great for Seattle!
Management - FOCUS on what needs to be changed and fixed and stop adding products that just increase the bad contrast of this place!Our family recentle stayed for 3 nights at the Best Western Plus Executive Inn. We wanted to stay in Seattle after our cruise and this hotel proved to be a very good choice. We stayed for three nights and encountered no problems of any kind. Because we needed to leave luggage right after disembarking from our cruise ship, we requested luggage storage until check-in time. The staff was very helpful with this, and we were able to tour the Seattle Center area while our rooms were being cleaned and readied for check in.
The hotel doesn't really feel like a 3-star facility and shows signs of ""wear and tear"", but our rooms were clean, spacious, and sufficient for our needs. We had a microwave, mini fridge, king sized bed, and flat screen TV. The free WiFi worked very well. The view out our window was not attractive, but for the price we paid, we just looked out at the skyline--not the ground level.
I felt the restaurant buffet was a bit expensive because I've stayed in many Best Western hotels that offer an expanded continental breakfast for no additional charge. This buffet offered scrambled eggs, cereal, make-your-own waffles, bacon, assorted breads, juices, etc. I wouldn't actually considered it a ""hot meal"" but it was good and was a reasonable option to fast food. 
The real strengths of the hotel are its staff and location. They helped us with directions, setting up airport transportation, giving us coupons for local restuarants, and much more. I requested wake-up calls that came every morning right on time. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful throughout our stay.
The location of the hotel itself was perfect for our needs. It was close to the monorail, which we rode to downtown and back for our sightseeing around town. McDonald's was very near and so was Walgreen's. Everything was an easy walk, which saved us a good bit of money. There was no need to pay car rental or parking for a car. Yes, there were some homeless people in the area, but you see them throughout much of Seattle and other big cities too. They never offered to bother us, and we never felt unsafe during our stay.
The hotel is not new or fancy, but the strengths clearly outweigh any negatives, and I would stay here again without any hesitation.Have to say was a little worried about some of the reviews. But there was no need to worry. Our stay here was great. It was an easy trip on the light rail and then monorail from the airport. We only had to walk a couple blocks to get to our room. Our room was comfortable- nice and big, comfortable king size bed with nice bedding. We had a fridge and micro-wave in the room. There was a bar and restaurant. The bartender, Cheryl was great!!! Everyone was helpful at the hotel and the room was always cleaned well. 
They have a couple of washer and dryers in the fitness room area - which is great when you travel light. 
We had a view of the Space Needle which was great, too! There is a lot of talk about the noise. We slept great. One night there was emergency sirens from an ambulance or fire truck, but you are in a city after all and things happen. There were a couple of homeless people in the area- but again you are in a city. I never felt unsafe. 
The monorail is right there and bus stops are all nearby. You can walk to the waterfront in 10 minutes even with your luggage. It was a great stay. I would recommend it to anyone.We loved this hotel. The location was wonderful and so was the price. The front desk personnel were very helpful and knowledgeable. Everything went crazy on our last night there. We were two childhood friends who met in Seattle for a vacation. We were talking about old times, just talking, no TV or music when we had a knock on the door. We asked who it was and the answer was ""security, open the door"". We did not, and when we called the front desk they said that there had been a complaint (lol) but the security people should not have asked us to open our door. I'm still confused about all of this nonsense. If there was a complaint, why didn't the front desk just call our room and ask us to keep it down. It's too bad that such a crazy thing happened, and we will never stay there again.Of three hotels stayed in during May 2012 trip -- Vancouver, Victoria, Seattle -- this was worst. Uncomfortable beds, funky shower, $15 parking charge. Hotel has a run down feel. Only plus was the location next to Seattle Center -- Space Needle, museums, etc.I stayed here for the one night after travelling down from Vancouver on the 'Quick Shuttle' which dropped me off right at the hotel. The hotel is nothing spectacular to look at from the outside in comparison to some of the newer ones in the area but hey 'never judge a book by its cover'!!
Inside the hotel is clean and well looked after, my room was spotlessly clean, very big and had everything I needed for my stay. I didnt have a space needle view but looked out to the back of the hotel which was very quiet...had the best nights sleep ever as the bed was so comfortable.
The hotel for me was in a great location as it was minutes from the space needle and the monorail which took me downtown although I did walk from the hotel to downtown which really wasnt that far.
I had an excellent meal in Brellas in the evening and the next morning I opted for the buffet breakfast which was certainly worth the money. Food and service could not be faulted.
I always check out the reviews on tripadvisor before I book a hotel and this hotel certainly lived up to my expectations.
Highly recommend this hotel and will most definitely stay again.The Hotel was dated. The room was clean but it was like you were in the 70s or 80s. There was constuction in the area starting at 7:00 AM. The one bright point was the breakfast buffet for $7.95 it was worth it, I had just came off a 7 day cruises and the hotel buffet was better. The eggs weren't cold and runny. the bacon was not thin and tasteless. It was small but everything was good.We stayed here on May 8 & 9 and really enjoyed our stay. I chose this location because it is sooo close to the Seattle Center attractions especially the SciFi Museum and the Music Museum. (virtually across the street) We had a great time here! The hotel is clean and well maintained. The decor was attractive and the beds comfortable. However, there is no pool here, which would have been nice. The staff in the restaurant were very personable and went out of their way to be helpful, even offering suggestions on things to see and do in Seattle. I especially appreciated Josh and Cheryl in the restaurant for their helpfulness. Great breakfast buffet as well. We'd definately stay here again.The reviews on this hotel were excellent. 
We came with relatively high expectations.
It is a true 3 star hotel, nothing more.
Seals on the windows were poor and as such there was a lot of traffic noise and construction in the area.
Lifts were incredibly slow.
Decor was ok.
Beds were good as were the linens - nice and clean.
It is a handy location - right near the Space Needle and Monorail, but on a pretty gritty block - definitely recommend the Space Needle side as we didn't book that and had the noisy construction and ugly outlook to the freeway.This hotel is in an ideal location - immediate access to the Seattle Centre attractions and a five minute cheap monorail ride to downtown. The hotel is extremely clean and comfortable with a lovely, relaxing entry lounge, excellent well-staffed reception and with easy access to rooms. The restaurant (with its great, in-expensive breakfast buffet) is very well located and with a good, tasty menu. Most of all - the best feature of the hotel is the staff- they are very polite, friendly, extremely helpful and proficient in their duties.
I woulkd heartuilky recommend this fine hotel to anyone planninhg a visit to Seattle - it wil become your home from home... with freshly baked, free cookies in the lounge every night as you get back from your exciting day !i am sitting right now in a great room in this hotel. the space needle is taking up the whole view from my window. the room is huge, the t.v. even bigger. the service from the front desk, and the management is top notch. the bed triple sheeted just the way i like them. no one ever treats me the way that best western does, and this hotel lived up to that expectation in every way. i only wish i could stay longer.Clean, reasonably priced - we picked ""eat sleep and park"" package - decent deal. Great buffet breakfast. Helpful friendly staff. Overall good for 1 or 2 night stop over in Seattle.We are stayting at the Best Western - Executive Inn in Seattle. The staff provided outstanding service: we especially appreciate the service provided by Kaylie to plan the stay and the outstanding effort to make our stay in Seattle fun. Danielle, and all the staff we met at the front desk went out of their way to provide oustanding customer service. The bartender from Hawaii (I can't remember his name) even recommended the best pizza rest. locally. Amazing service - this is really a Best Western Premier in my opinion. Very nice stay.
The breakfast was also outstanding, very good. The view of the Space Needle is show stopper amazing! I am looking at the Space Needle right now with the dark blue sky, and monorail going by . . . it is amazing! If you are going to Seattle, this is a very good hotel!We just wanted people be aware that this could happen to you.
We had booked 2 rooms for a party of 4, from a well known travel site for one night on our way back from or trip to Florida . I had paid for the rooms via this travel site well before we left on our holiday
And up to that point the holiday was perfect... then The Best Western incident happened.
We had arrived in Seattle after flying back from Florida around 11pm and was looking forward to a nice sleep at what looked like a very nice hotel, from what I saw from the hotel's website and was rated very high for its rooms and beds, which is what someone looks forward to after 8 hours in flight ,we also had to catch the Amtrak train back to Vancouver B.C @ 7:40am the next morning.
When we arrived at the hotel from the airport the limo driver unloaded our bags as we had 8 bags between the 4 of us and and we put them on the ground and waited for a bellman who never came. I sent my wife,daughter and mother into the lobby as I dealt with the bags on the ground. when I did walk in and talked with desk staff the lady there looked at me strangely and informed me that the staff before her shift had given our rooms to another party ,even though my credit card was the one on file. She then asked me for ID to prove to her who I was. I suggested that they might have done that to the party who they had given our rooms too, and then asked how this could happen when the names given by the party that occupied our paid rooms did not even come close to our parties name. The front desk just looked at me , my 79 year old mother and wife and daughter and apologized for the mix up. When we asked for replacement rooms they told us that they had none. Wonderful stuck in Seattle and it is now after midnight, I asked the staff what they were going to do and they told us they would set us up in their sister hotel.
What a joke that was, we loaded our bags ourselves into a taxi that would not even get out of the car and was taken over to the sister hotel called the Six Avenue Inn, which looked like a run down back alley motel, which had a stench of stale beer in the stained carpeted lobby .with the local homeless sleeping in the lobby. We were appalled and refused to stay in such a run down place after what we had booked at the best western plus executive inn on 200 Taylor Ave. By 2am they agreed to set us up at local Holiday inn express and we agreed after they told us they would cover the competitor's hotel cost for the inconvenience . The Holiday inn was a nice experience as their staff was very accommodating. Since that horrible night at the best western, I have contacted the travel website 3 times in the last 8 days and they tried to contact the hotel
To remedy the ordeal,each time the contacted the hotel they were told the manager was unavailable and to try back,one travel customer service person told me that they we even hung up on as they tried to call back a second time. I know i have rambled on but if I can save one person from this disaster I will be satisfied that Best Western does not get a chance to do this to someone else who pays in advance and still gets the worst customer service i ever had experienced. By the way ,when we got to our Holiday Inn rooms it was around 3am so i sat up in my bed and clock watched for 5am to come so we could catch our train home. We still are waiting for best western to fix this problem, even though we received a nice email from head office saying that they will be in touch that was 8 days ago. I suggest trying one of the other chains of hotels in Seattle to avoid this happening to your family.I was attending a breakfast meeting at this hotel yesterday. the breakfast that was served was outstandaing. The eggs were prepared just right, the bacon and home fries were perfect. I really apprecated the attention to detail shown by the staff. Nicly done.This hotel is across the street then exactly 1 block from the Space Needle. All the rooms on the west side will have an excellent view of it. The hotel provided a good stay for me.
Pros:
Wide, spacious room
Good value for being near the central business district
Big flatscreen TV (I didn't turn it on so I can't comment on HD availability)
Breakfast buffet was good quality, and quite varied in selections available. You do pay for the buffet however, unlike some other Best Western properties. The price is reasonable and children eat free.
Comfortable bed
Closest lodging to the Space Needle
Although it has been updated, the hotel maintains a retro feel, much like the Space Needle.
Cons:
Parking costs extraNice motel, clean, rooms are warm and smell good. Bathrooms clean. Has free wifi! Parking is $18/night, but this is good considering most of the other motels and hotels charge $25. Great blackout drapes, quiet neighborhood. Restaurant is a little pricey, but nice. Restaurant only open at odd times but there is a McDonald's on the next block. This place is almost next to the Space Needle! 
I like this place, handy and inviting with terrific front desk staff.Excellent location, 2 blocks far from Space Needle. The restaurant had a perfect breakfast buffet, and the parking was free. 5 minutes driving to main spots in downtown.my sister and i have stayed at this best western a few times now and it just gets better
 verry friendly and clean,they went out of thier way to make us a meal even when the resterant was closed.would recoment this hotel in seattleGreat location, wonderful staff, and incredibly clean. The restaurant had a perfect breakfast buffet, and we were very impressed with the view of the Space Needle!This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel. It's clean & tidy in a nice area of town close to the Monorail which drops you right in the heart of the shopping district. The adjacent Queen Ann neighborhood is one of my favorite areas for restaurants & entertainment. Bella's restaurant in the hotel is a great place to start the day with a breakfast buffet attended by friendly staff. Very affordable.The staff was very patient with my concerns about my credit card. The staff at the front desk were also very nice to me. Mattress was a little too firm for me.When I called to make a reservation, I was assured that the Executive Inn was not just for business travelers. So my wife and I spent our anniversary there. We got a very nice room with a view to the west, of the Space Needle, Seattle Center, and Olympic Mountains (weather permitting). The surroundings are a little rough, including street demolition/construction while we were there. But we were able to walk to the the monorail and even took an extended walk to the waterfront one day. The room was very nice and the staff were pleasant. I probably would have given it five stars if not for the daily parking fee of $15, which seems excessive. No wonder the parking garage was nearly empty.We contracted with BW to hold a scientific conference of 200 fisheries biologists and scientists for four days. We used the Grand Ballroom for the oral presentations in a theater arrangement and the space and chairs were fully used. We used two screens raised on risers, and they were placed on either side of the speaker. This helped attendees to clearly view the information being presented and compensate for the two columns in the middle of the room. We also used the columns as aisles to minimize the dead space behind the columns. 
We used the back of the room for two lines of poster boards and the two side rooms (Whidbey-Shaw and Lee-Vashon) for both posters and for lunches. All of this was cozy, but the BW staff was more than accommodating to work around the spaces and with the organizing committee. For lunches, BW staff had buffets and table rounds in each of the side rooms and also used the restaurant as overflow areas. We also contraced for the all-day break package which was kept stocked with a variety of fresh foods, coffee, and drinks.
The food was excellent. The catering staff prepared themed lunches that were tasty and fresh and were very much complimented by attendees. We also had two h'ordeurve parties, and the choices cooked up by the chef and kitchen were delicious. I will definitely consider using the catering component if I have any other functions in the downtown area. 
We liked the location of the facility as it is away from the congestion and hub-bub of downtown Seattle. There is plenty of parking, at least during the winter days, and the hotel is near bus lines and reachable from the airport by taking the light rail and monorail. We also chose this facility because of its affordable costs--both in terms of rooms and catering--they outcompeted other nearby places and we did not suffer in quality at all.
Overall, the best part of working with the BW was the friendliness, efficiency, and eagerness of the catering and facilities staff to work with the conference organizers. Minor problems were quickly solved, the costs were clearly identified, meals were easily worked out, and all of this made it easier for the organziers to execute the conference. Attendees remarked on the high quality of the food and the seamlessness of the facility and staff in supporting the meeting.I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions over the past few years - both on my own and with family members - when visiting relatives in Washington State. It is in an ideal location within walking distance of space needle, science museum, monorail and across the road from the 'duck ride' - a must if you visit Seattle! The rooms have always been clean and comfortable and the staff helpful and friendly. I was disappointed to find that the restaurant has changed from offering breakfast and dinner with waitress service to self-service breakfast and limited fast food evening snacks. A sign of the times I guess which is unfortunate. Apart from this I would highly recommend it.Great location, walking distance to Pike Place, Space Needle, and Children's Museum. Staff were very friendly, rooms clean and spacious, nice to have the sink outside of the actual bathroom. Traveled with our two girls ages 3 & 5. The only downside was the fitness room/spa was not clean, we went in once and did not return to it. The restaurant for the buffet breakfast was nice and clean and the variety was great, well worth the price. The staff were excellent and provided wonderful service, very friendly, remembered our names and what we liked to drink with breakfast. Front desk staff were courteous and prompt. Would've appreciated some suggestions on where to eat etc. Found recommendations online. This is our go-to hotel in Seattle.Most reviews talk about this site's proximity to the Space Needle, which to true, but it is also close to the convention center and downtown. Nice large clean room ,comfortable bed, and a full service buffet breakfast and lounge. Josh's service in the lounge was great.I stayed at the Best Western Plus Executive Inn at the Space Needle in October 2011. Not only were the accommodations splendidly comfortable, but the front desk staff was particularly helpful. I had one of my sleep-time distresses of stuffiness and the help staff helped find me some relief. In addition to this extraordinary effort beyond the call of duty, the location is exceptional for a walk into the downtown business district. If you go down 5th on your way you will pass an unique business that looks like a restaurant, but is actually an advertising agency. The staff encouraged the walk past and it is the height of Seattle weirdness. Enjoy Seattle and stay at the Best Western Plus.Thanks to good Trip Advisor reviews, we took a chance with this hotel in a funky area near the Space Needle. Turned out it was super easy to walk to the Space Needle/Key Arena, we felt safe, and there was a convenient Walgreens a block away. The staff was amazingly friendly, the lobby was cozy with a big fireplace and inviting couches, the room was lovely and clean, and even the breakfast (extra $8 charge per person) was a delight. This was a great value even with the extra $15 parking charge, and we would definitely stay here again if we were to visit Seattle Center or even downtown Seattle. (The monorail station toward downtown is just a 2-3 block walk.)I felt so welcome from the moment I walked in: The front desk staff was hospitable, friendly and cordial. The lounge has two of Seattle's best bartenders: Cheryl and Josh. They will make you feel right at home! The location is convenient. Prices very affordable. A truly outstanding choice.This Best Western isn't bad. 
Paid extra for the room with the Space Needle view. Exterior structure of the building has a large overhang blocks the view at the lower section of the Needle. You can't see the top of the Space needle unless you're by the window. It was a little disappointing that we couldn't see it from our bed (It's a HUGE ROOM and bed is 10 ft from the window). Might be a better view from a higher floor. 
Room is outdated, but HUGE! King bed looks small in this room. TV is new LCD type about 40""? I was a little suprised and disappointed at first, but it was very clean and the bed was comfortable. 
Despite the negatives, the location of this hotel is great for couples and families wanting to walk to everything. The Space Needle is 2 blocks away. Tons to do nearby without crossing any major roadways. Other newer hotels I was looking at were on the other side of the highway. This place is 2 blocks from the Needle, monorail, Seattle Center, etc. Good price for parking at the hotel.Picked this hotel from the Best Western website at the last minute. I had no idea what to expect and wasn't really hoping for much since I was rushed and didn't take the time I normally would have to do some research. We got to our room, opened up the curtains and were amazed! Beautiful room, amazing city views. From the moment we walked in, we were treated like royalty. Helpful, courteous and friendly staff at every encounter. We have found our Seattle hotel!The rooms are beautiful and the lobby cozy plus the hotel is in walking distance to the space needle, 5 Points Cafe and many more great places. We got room 502 and the view was to die for.We stayed over for one night so we could go explore Seattle. We were greated with great front desk staff and friendly service through out the stay. Wonderful rooms with great shower pressure and hot water was fantastic with all four of us taking showers. Beds were nice and comfy and the view was simply breathtaking. We did eat the buffet breakfast and was very impressed with the quality of food very yummy. Overall this was a great hotel with friendly staff, great rooms, wonderful views what more can you ask for? Another huge perk is its so close to everything so you dont even have to drive to be able to explore the area!The staff are truly excellent. I love this hotel!The outside of this hotel is just ok but everything else about this Best Western is great: It has a fantastic location near the Seattle Center, a secure parking garage, a very friendly staff, large and clean rooms, comfy beds, includes fridge and microwave, free wireless, adjustable shower heads with good pressure, fantastic space needle view, a good full buffet breakfast, and a great value. Those that only judge a book by its cover, will miss out on this hotel. The rest of us will enjoy this hidden gem. A special thanks to Mary Fischer, Director of Sales and Marketing, who went above and beyond to help us plan a perfect trip. We will be back.We went to Seattle with our 2 teen age boys for a week end of Christmas shopping and family getaway. We chose this hotel because of the location price and reviews. From the moment we arrived we were more than pleased. This property is older but extremely clean and nicely decorated for Christmas. We did not have reservations and arrived unannouced at about 6:pm we were greeted by the night clerk Kelly who was amazing while checking us in he asked key questions what is the purpose of our stay, offering ideas on what to do where to go all while just checking us in. They had fresh cookies in the lobby that were so yummy. Gave us ideas on dinner and because of the Seattle weather (rainy) he even offered to check us out umbrellas if we wanted to walk around. Parking and breakfast was included with our nightly stay. Explaining about the breakfast buffet and where to park, and since there was four of us in one room he would be sending up extra towel. Thank you. All this and check in was speedy taking only minutes to check us in and get to know us. The rooms were comfy and very clean. Again and older hotel but extremely clean and comfortable with 5 star service and central location to downtown entertainment and Pike Place market. Had a great week end . Will definately stay at this hotel again while visiting SeattleFor anyone wanting to get a firsthand view of Seattle,this hotel makes it really easy.We booked a room on one of the upper levels and asked for a room with a view.We got a spectacular view of the Space Needle.On the ground you find yourself in easy walking distance from the aforementioned Space Needle as well as the EMP,Seattle Center and the Pacific Science Center.The Key Arena-home to basketball games and other entertainment events is close by as well.To access downtown shopping and the Pike's Place Market and Alaskan Way waterfront it is possible to walk.Those that want to save their legs can take the local bus or hop on the Monorail which is inside the Seattle Center.
The hotel itself on the outside is no example of great architecture.The giant concrete slabs on the exterior can only complement the concrete causeway close by.Having said that, once inside the hotel all is forgotten as the windows and walls let in no external noise. The room itself was very clean and the decor was very pleasing.The lobby staff were always very patient and helpful.The lobby has a very cozy lounge area with a fireplace.There's a small computer room behind the office open to the public where you have access to computers and a printer.Underground,secure parking is available -at $15 a day.Street parking outside the hotel is limited to a few hours-the parking police are vigilant.
There is a breakfast,dining lounge but that also is an extra cost.It's a full buffet breakfast not the usual Best Western express fare..There was a good selection of foods and the staff wait your tables to offer beverages.My only complaint was that the head of the dining room was a little too tense and he made us feel pressured if we hadn't left the dining room by the end of breakfast time.I am guessing that the reason being is that many conferences are held at the hotel due to it's central location and the dining room is in constant use during the day so the head is on a tight schedule.However if you miss breakfast at the hotel there are many alternatives close by.There's a Whole Foods about ten minutes walk away. Our favorite dinner spot was a late night pizza place called Bambino's.They are very low key and offer a select menu of wood-fired pizzas and fresh Italian salads at reasonable prices.
I would definitely recommend this Best Western.You can't fault the location and the efficiency of the staff and the neat presentation of the rooms are always appreciated.This is an older hotel but in a great location. Looks like they have attempted to update the decor. There are flat screen tv's in the rooms. Easy access onto the freeway and walking distance to numerous pubs and restaurants. Staff was friendly and helpful. Parking is $15/nite but is in a secure underground parkade. Mono rail and space needle are minutes away.Being that it was my first trip to Seattle, I decided to stay at the Best Western Executive because of the location, value, and awesome reviews it received on Trip Advisor. I was not dissappointed at all. The location was perfect for my vacation needs and the accomodations were just excellent! I got a room with a view of the Space Needle, that in itself was worth the extra cost. The room was fantastically decorated, clean, and very very comfortable. I used the monorail at Seattle Center to make my shopping trips to Seattle's Retail Core and the location was central to my trips to Steven's Pass, Woodland Zoo, Pike's Market, and Argosy Cruise boats at Pier 56. Having Space Needle and Seattle Center across the street was a true bonus. There are many great places to eat in walking distance of the hotel. Although I was out and adventuring most of my stay, when I did interact with Staff, they are extremely helpful and provide Customer Service above and beyond what is needed. The front desk staff are awesome, they always provide an warm and sincere greeting when you enter. One in particular (sorry I forgot his name) provided me great information that led to my impromptu decision to go snowboarding at Steven's Pass. The food at Brella's (Restaurant in Hotel) is awesome with great menu choices and prices were very good. I ordered room service twice while I was there and Zach who works at Brella's and delivered the food, is like all the other hotel staff: great, awesome, and exemplifies excellent customer service. Upon my return to Hawaii I recommended the Best Western Executive Seattle to my friends and family should they travel to Seattle. Next time I visit Seattle, I definitely will be staying at Best Western Executive Seattle.We read the previous reviews, and based upon the responses of the Asst Mgr (Dana) I figured this hotel would have great staff (I was right). What blew us away was the location - next to the Space Needle and an easy, fun 12 minute walk to lower Queen Anne neighborhood and a plethora of great restaurants and bars (try Ten Mercer and Tolouse). The rooms are huge, updated, and very clean. The mattresses and pillows are new and absolutely great - had a restful sleep every night. The Staff is such a great team and EXTREMELY customer focused. We had a problem (like many did) with a noisy room on our floor. The Staff moved us, took care of us, and even left a considerate note in the room. Front desk clerk suggested a limo service when the cab company said 20 min wait - he confirmed the price was darn close to the taxi fare and visited us in the bar to say he had the arrangements made. Had the chance to meet Dana and complimented him on the high standards of customer service from his Staff. GREAT value.Four generations of women in my family meet at this hotel each December for a weekend of fun and Christmas shopping. We are able to walk to the Seattle Center and get on the monorail to downtown, which is wonderful not having to negotiate traffic or worry about downtown parking. Great place to stay and great value. I highly recommend this hotel. We'll be back next year!My experience with the staff and the hotel was a great experience. I stayed at the hotel because of the location for my business travel, but would recommend this hotel to all. The staff and especially the management were very helpful and responsive to all my needs and request. The rooms were extremely comfortable and clean with all the amenities needed for business and vacation travel. The staff would go out of their way to help with all issues. Dana Weber the manager always assisted with my reservations and was always available for any questions and issues. Overall, just a great experience and I would recommend to everyone.This hotel was amazing, the staff friendly, management was helpful. I used a Best Western Travel Card and it had a remaining balance after I checked out. I forgot to get the card when I checked out, so they mailed it to me. Great service!!!I cannot believe how well I slept. It was quiet inside and out. The bed was extremely comfortable and you could actually adjust the room temperature without a huge effort. I was also very impressed that they had a special remote control for the (big) LCD that was designed so it could be easily sanitized. They also have enclosed parking and a reasonably priced breakfast buffet. The staff (front desk, maintenance and housekeeping) were all extremely friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay here again - for the money, it cannot be beat.This was our first time to Seattle, and I have not in previous times and/or places been crazy about Best Western Inn. This trip had two nights in Seattle, one on Victoria Island (via Clipper) and then back to Seattle. We stayed at another hotel on the way in, but should have stayed @ this Best Western Executive Inn: everything was so well done. Breakfast (major reason for choosing it) was really good - not continental stuff; proximity to transportation (monorail), space needle and water-front experiences were not to be beat.
The room was not the latest and most refined, but they are nice, attractive and clean. We're thinking we'll have to visit again since we really didn't get to do much; and before I spring for an expensive room where I spend little time, BWEI will be the place. You can't go wrong.I can not rate this hotel but would like to say how friendly the staff on the front desk were and nothing was to much trouble and they even had a tourist information stand.much better than the hotel Istayed at during my stay in Seattle ,while I waited for the shuttle to Vancouver.Iwill give them a go during my next visitAs always a great stay. Had some noisy neighbors, but not hotels fault. Close to everything wer needed and extremely courteous and friendly staff. Restaurant was good, food and service. Will stay again for sureWe stayed here overnight to catch a shuttle to Vancouver, BC, for a cruise. It was close to the Space Needle, which worked well for me as I had to pick up something in their gift shop for a friend. It wasn't an area I would wander around much at night though. There weren't many restaurants in the area we would walk to at night, so we ate at the hotel and it was pretty good. The room was clean and larger than most hotel rooms these days. It was a bit on the old side and needed some updating. It was pretty quiet and worked out well for one night. It wasn't in the center of Seattle, so if you wanted to be near downtown to walk to restaurants and Pikes Place Market, this is a bit out of the way.We stayed here for several days while job hunting--the staff was super helpful. The rooms were clean. We didn't try the restaurant for food but the coffee was great. The staff was so kind and helpful to us in assisting with our interview process and what not. The parking was safe and secure. Great view of space needle--I'd say for the price, we got more than we expected. Oh, the fresh, warm cookies in the afternoon were a definite plus!Booked as part of a Delta vacation package. Staff was friendly, room was OK if dated with a motel feel. Bed was comfortable. They put is in a handicapped room near the elevator and we should have asked to be moved but we were tired. Handicapped shower was an adventure but workable. First two nights (weekday) were quiet as far as hotel guests were concerned but we were direectly over an alley and the dumpsters got emptied at 4 the first morning and about 5:30 on the second morning. That Friday night a group of women attending a convention checked in and held conversations in the hallway at 3 in the morning.
We had breakfast vouchers as part of the package but only used them on one day since we slept in the next two days and couldn't get to the buffet the last day because about two dozen convention women were lined up into the hallway. The one day we did have the buffet, it was good and the service was great.
One nitpicking thing was that we couldn't turn off the closed captioning on the TV. I assume because this was a handicapped room.
The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout and arranged a towncar to get us to the airport on our last day. Staff was the best part of the stay.Stayed there 2 nights before flying home. Although we arrived early from train, we were allowed to have a room and were given choice of view of Space Needle or Downtown. We took Space Needle, good choice. Although the outside and hallways look old and tired the room was great and the service way fantastic. The room was very roomy and clean. There was a nice big lounge chair to sit in (great after a long day walking). It is a short walk to Space Needle and the monorail. If you are a senior it is only $1 to go downtown and you are there in 5 minutes. I would recommend doing the Space Needle, taking the Monorail downtown, doing the Underground tour then taking the trolly bus to the lake and taking the little ferry, near the wooden boats to the Uni and back. Then take the trolly bus back downtown. Best Western thanks for a wonderful last 2 nights in US before flying home to Australia.Recently ,we attended the U.S. Air Force 38th WWII Bomb Group Reunion in Seattle. Our home base was the Best Western Plus Ex. Inn conveniently near downtown Seattle, the Space Needle and the Metro and bus lines. The staff there was absolutely outstanding to our veterans, wives, and families. In addition to answering all our transportation, sightseeing, and general information questions, the staff treated everyone as if we were members of their own families. The managers even ran out and purchased a CD player for our group's use as we listened to music of the 1940's in our hospitality room. When one of the veterans celebrated his 93rd. birthday, the kitchen crew prepared a surprise personalized cake and the staff even bought and signed a birthday card for him, joining us in sharing this happy time. Every need we had was met quickly and with a smile no matter which employee we asked. The housecleaning staff deserves additional recognition for the extremely clean rooms, lobby, computer room and bar area. This group of men from the GREATEST GENERATION deserves this type of respect and care provided by the Best Western Plus Ex. Inn. and you , too, will receive such treatment there. J. YoderAt Great place, Room was very nice, big and comfortable, Hotel staff were greatDuring my last trip to Seattle, several cruise ships were in town as was a convention so I booked my hotel stay on Hotwire and ended up with this hotel. When I first approached it, near the Space Needle, it looked stuck in the early 80's and looks like it's ready for demolition. However, once I reached the lobby I was surprised; it was updated, comfortable with a huge fireplace and the desk staff were nice. Although this hotel still has a dark inside appearance and low ceilings in the hallways, the rooms have been freshened and are actually large! Flat screen TV, free wireless internet that reached full strength, refrigerator, fantastic comfortable bed and beautiful views of Capitol Hill from the 4th floor. The bathroom, however, is ridiculously small but the water pressure was good and everything worked. 
All in all it was a good stay. You can't always judge by what you see on the exterior. This is also close to Gateway where there are several restaurant choices and a Whole Foods. 15 minute walk to downtown.I did not have a reservation. I booked a room for the weekend (Sat./Sun). The first BW was sold out. I ended up with this BW. Check-in was friendly and helpful. However, it took some time, because the gentleman had to answer phone calls at the same time. Even though, there was a male employee using a computer, not having a customer. He should have answered the phone.
The location is very close to the Space Needle and therefore everything can be done by walking to the major attraction. Very convenient. WI-FI is for free . Parking and breakfast has to be paid for. The price is a little bit on the high side.
The room was big. It was clean. Sink, fridge and microwave. The ice-, vending- and pop machines are located not where the elevator is, but along the hall way . The wisdom escapes me. Be sure that your room is not too close to it. The ice machine is noisy. I also recommend to choose room son the upper level.
There are buildings with A/C units close to the Hotel.
Breakfast buffet (again , you have to pay for it), is very good. 
Check-out was fast and friendly.We stayed at the BWP Executive Inn following an Alaska Cruise. We arrived about 10:00 am and were pleasantly surprised that we could check into our room which was neat and clean. Walking less than five minutes we arrived at the Seattle Center which has the Space Needle, Experience Music Project, Pacfic Science Center and the Monorial speeding you downtown within 3 blocks of Pikes Market. Staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful assisting us with directions, coupons and transportation to Sea-Tac at the end of our stay. Great location and customer service with good quality accomodations. I'd recommend it and would stay there again.Spent 3 nights. A little worn yet clean with nice staff. Walking distance to space needle and monorail. The Monorail drops you downtown & an easy walk to Pike Place Market and other attractions. Some surprise at extra charges for parking & if we had known we would have delayed the pickup of our rental car by a day. The restaurant in the motel served a decent breakfast. Overall, I'd recommend this as a good place to stay for the price.
A note on rental cars, saved substantial amount by picking up downtown instead of airport and the motel staff arranged a limo pickup at the airport; a nice service.We stayed at the Best Western right in front of the Space Needle. At $150.00 per night, it was just ok In addition to the cost of the room you will have to pay $15.00 per day to park. There is no pool, and the fitness room is alright, but nothing above average. They have cut down on services, by selling it to you as going green, truth is they are saving money and charging you the same. Going green, but still using plastic no biodegradable, not from recycled materials, disposable coffee cups, filters, etc. The restaurant downstairs is awful, so steer away completely. At $99.00 a night I would have called it a good value, but it is way overpriced for what you get. We could have stayed 10 minutes away at the hotel Sierra, for less money, and got more.They should have told us about the $15.00 parking fee and the $7.50 breakfast charge when making the reservation or had it on the internet. All other was fine.We spent 2 nights at this hotel, with a view of the Space Needle and small no traffic - goes-by side of the street. We slept on very comfortable beds. We had spent more time outside the hotel, so furniture, TV and etc were not a really matter for us, but all is in good condition. Parking was included as a discount at the moment when I did online reservation. That was good because it is a locked lot underneath the building. We liked the breakfast buffet, that was pretty good, but we wish it could be included in the price we paid for our stay (breakfast was at $7.50 per person). We noticed that when we were need to ask about locals attractions, restaurants, bus stops, etc, a desk clerk was busy all the time to proved with detail answers. But the hotel has a downtown are map to provide their guests, you should ask for that at the reception. Basically, the location is in a walking distance to almost everything we planned to see and attend as that was our first visit in Seattle. We found that price-comfort-service combination is good for 3 days to stay in this Hotel. This Hotel cares about preservation of an environment: about it spoke all signs, polite reminders and so forth, that has left a good impression too. We already have recommended this hotel to our friends.The Best Western Plus Executive Inn is a nice clean hotel located within walking distance of many Seattle attractions (Seattle Space Needle, Ride the Ducks, Seattle waterfront, Pike Place Market, the mono-rail). It's also a short cab ride to Safeco Field to watch the Mariners play baseball. I would righly recommend this hotel.We spent 3 nights at this hotel, with a view of the Space Needle. The hotel is a little older, but it is well maintained. Our room had middle aged furniture in good condition. Parking was $15 per night, worth it because it is a locked lot underneath the building. The surrounding neighborhood appears safe in the daytime. On one night a 2:30AM, someone was talking loudly on the street, not the hotel's fault. We did not try the breakfast buffet at $7.50 per person, but we heard from other guests that it was pretty good. We slept soundly in a comfortable bed and woke up each morning in a good mood.
When we checked in, we arrived a little early--1:30PM. The desk clerk, David, told me that the room was not ready yet, would probably not be ready for another hour, and might not be ready until 4PM. Taken aback, I told him we would return. I discussed the situation with my wife and we decided that we would cancel the reservation and book a room somewhere else. When I returned to the front desk, I was greeted by a female clerk as David was busy with someone else. I explained to her that I was cancelling my 3 day reservation and that I would find another hotel that has a room ready. Within 30 seconds, she offered me a room with two queen beds in place of the reserved room of one king bed at the same rate. Not really wanting to look for another room at the last minute on a Saturday, we accepted the substitute. 
While our stay was satisfactory, we may sample the competition next time. I can never understand why the management of some hotels do not provide adequate training to the employees. Perhaps they have so much business that they don't need return guests. Apparently, management does not understand that travelers have enough aggravation finding the hotels that they don't need aggravation from a desk clerk!I stayed in this hotel for one night after travelling by bus from Vancouver. Location is perfect as the bus drops you off outside. I was early (check-in is quite late at 4 p.m.) so room was not ready. Very helpful staff upgraded me to Space Needle view room which was extremely large and included lounge area. Very clean, well equipped and fabulous view. One block from the Space Needle and with access to quick monorail service to downtown for $2 made this an ideal place for a quick visit. It is amazing what I managed to see in just 24 hours. Had dinner in the restaurant (more like a pub cafe really but none the less very good.) I do not usually eat hamburgers but after watching the next table receive theirs, it looked so good I ordered the plain one. It was delicious and one of the best I have had anywhere. The cost for the whole meal including a drink and fries and coleslaw was less than $12 which was very good value for money. The waiting staff were a little eccentric but very friendly. As I said, it is more of a pub/cafe so 3 TVs going so not the place for a quiet dinner. Breakfast was rather disappointing as the food was of limited variety and quite tepid - a faily normal problem I find with buffets. Had to instruct them how to make tea but very helpful staff. I have seen comments on 'smell' in the hotel so took particular note but have to say although it was obviously not smelling of roses, have experienced far worse - it had a hotel smell, what more can I say! I would definitely recommend this hotel for its location and amenities. When we return next year, I will definitely stay here again.We didn't like the locatiion of this hotel. The area felt a little seedy, and we were not interested the space needle or other dated attractions nearby. 
Next time I would stay within walking distance of Pike Place markets. 
The room was clean enough and big enough.Location is nice... within a few blocks of the Pike Market and really close by to the Space Needle. Also convenient that the buses to Vancouver depart from across the street. Helpful staff and clean room were a plus. Since it was a hotel from a national chain, the room was basic, but nice.We booked a two bed room weeks before, got email confirmation from the booking agency/hotel and when we arrived they said there was a glitch in the system and had to stay in a one bed room. 
They gave us the room with a view of a scummy parking lot instead of a view of the space needle, which is why I booked it in the first place. When I called to switch rooms they said there was none available...and to take a breakfast voucher. Well, I didn't come for a breakfast voucher. I came to have my own bed with a view of the space needle.
Never again.Very friendly, clean and convenient. Bar / rest in hotel was surprisingly good. Would come backWe stayed here 2 nights, July 28-30. We came from SeaTac using the Light Link and Monorail to Seatlle Center. It was very easy. See my trip report in the Seattle forum for specific directions. The hotel was less then 2 blocks from the Seattle Center which was a great location for our family, and not being directly downtown saved us a lot of money. We didn't use the monorail again to get downtown. We just walked, which wasn't bad at all! The hotel was clean, the staff friendly, price was reasonable and the breaksfast was great. Kids 11 and under are free which was a bonus. Eating here definately saved us money. If we are in Seattle again we will not hesitate to stay here again.This hotel is not in the better parts of Seattle although is one block from the Space Needle and the Rock and Roll Hall of fame. Neither are reasons to stay here.
We were staying for a conference and that was the only reason we chose this hotel. Regardless of the location of the conference, I will not stay there again.
This is a very tired, second rate type of hotel for those with little cash or those who don't care where they stay. I cannot imagine any executive staying here.
Check in was average. Clerks barely out of the their teens trying hard to welcome you.
The king room we had smelled strongly of industrial cleaners, BO and stale cigarettes. The view was charming; the alley below. The carpet was badly stained. There windows didn't open. The air conditioner stank and didn't cool the room. There were very suspicious stains all over the walls.
The bathroom was reasonably clean but cramped. The bed was surprisingly OK and we managed to get a decent rest. There is little soundproofing though.
The ""buffet"" breakfast is a cholesterol dream. Save your money.
The conference rooms were small but reasonable. Ice water was provided. The buffet dinner was quite good. Most of the silverware was clean.
I can't think of a reason why I would come back to this hotel next year. There must be better places to stay.
We did have an unbelievably good meal at Il Fornaio Italian restaurant downtown.This is a fairly old (looking at least) property on one side of the Seattle Center, near the Space Needle. Pluses: very pleasant front desk staff, clean and good-sized rooms, good location. Issues: I could not get the WiFi (supposedly free and available throughout the hotel) to work at all in the 2 days I was there. I reported this to the front desk staff who promised to contact the IT people, but the situation never improved. Even in the business center, the computers were slow and I finally gave up. Note to travelers with families: the breakfast served is only about as good as the free breakfasts I have in most hotels, but there is a charge for it! $7.95 plus tax and presumably a modest tip. Not worth it, in my opinion - the second day I had a muffin in my room purchased while out the first day. There IS a microwave and refrigerator in the rooms. Location is excellent for seeing the Seattle Center; it's not an area I as a single woman would feel comfortable walking back to alone at night though (unlike hotels on the other side of the Seattle Center). So... some pluses and some minuses - just be aware!I was looking for a place for my wife and I and our two teenage daughters to stay before embarking on our cruise from Seattle to Alaska. I usually stay at either a Marriott or Hilton property but not only were they either booked solid or asking over $350/night; all of them only advertised two DOUBLE BEDs in their rooms. I was pleasantly surprised when I found the Best Wester Plus Executive Inn with two QUEEN beds in the room, an excellent military discount ($137 per night including four free breakfasts), and a close location to the port. All in all a very good value and if I cruise out of Seattle again, I will definitely consider staying again.We stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to downtown and the Space Needle plus other attractions. I would definitely give it 10 out of 10 for location, our room was very large and had comfortable beds and the added bonus of a fridge. There were only 3 MINOR drawbacks (a) the fact that there was often only one clerk on duty at the desk and no bellboys or other front office staff to help anyone, so there was always a queue of people waiting for service or to get bags out of the back office, (b) they advertised free high speed internet in the rooms but ours did not work and the IT Help line couldn't get it to work, which was annoying as we need to use the internet for our business and (c) the 2 lifts were unbelievably slow but you could not use the stairs to get to the ground floor as the only door to the lobby is alarmed and for fire use only. These minor issues may not be a big deal to many people, but are worthwhile mentioning so that the management knows how to improve. Friends of ours were also staying there and also had problems getting internet in their room, so it was not an isolated problem. Internet was extremely slow anywhere in the hotel, including on the two provided computers near reception. Breakfast was not included in the price, but was a bit disappointing as far as value for money and variety.Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. Great location to everything. Monorail close by provided convenient transportation to shopping and restaurants. Microwave and refrigerator worked well for our snacks and soft drinks.Hotel carpets were extremely dirty and old!! The ceilings are very low and the whole hotel needs to be renovated!!! Staff was not knowledgeable about the area and could not even recommend restaurants. Breakfast buffet was ok. The location is very close to the Space Needle, which is good. Also parking is very expensive considering the price of the rooms...We expected more from a Best Western and were disappointed!We had never stayed here before our visit here in May . Had a couple of days to enjoy 
Seattle before our cruise to Alaska . This hotel was the perfect spot for us . 
Right across street from the Seattle Center and the Monorail . Hotel was spotless and the 
staff were friendly and helpful during our stay . Hope to stay someday again here.This is our 3rd. time staying in BW Executive Inn. We also recommend this hotel to our cousins and friends from Australia & Malaysia who stayed there too and loved it.
We all like our spacious rooms with view of Space Needle, the friendly reception and restaurant staff and buffet breakfast with great waffles. 
The hotel is next to the monorail, location is very convenient to most attractions, restaurants and shopping.
We would like to especially give our thanks to James Mann who helped us with the reservations for our 3 rooms, we had a great stay and family reunion in Seattle. 
We will be back!!!!!!
Thank-you everyone in BW Executive Inn.I stayed at this hotel pre cruise,the location is great, next to the Space Needle and the monorail which takes you into the centre of the city, then a quick walk and you are at Pikes market which is well worth a visit. The rooms are spacious, and the staff very helpful would recommend this hotel for your next visit.This hotel does need a bit of a refresh, but it wasn't unclean. Mattress was a bit firm, but room was quite adequate. The breakfast buffet and their morning server, Juvy, was a fantastic way to start the day. It is not that far of a walk to Pike Place Market, and super close to the Space Needle. Other restaurants and bars are close by as well.Having stayed here last year during a baseball trip to Seattle, we came back, once again with another couple, impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency of the place and the convenient location.
Clean – yes; efficient – not really. We made the reservation 75 days in advance but the front desk somehow screwed up one of the room requests, meaning a switch to a different room. After requesting and getting late checkout (noon instead of 11), we returned from breakfast at 11:30 to find our room keycard didn't work, and we had to revisit the very busy desk to get the automatic cancellation reversed. Neither room had a very efficient ventilation system and both featured quite uncomfortable pillows.
Overall, adequate, but with enough little problems to send us comparison shopping next time.Needs a good clean and tidy up. Going up to room struck by dirtiness of carpets and just lack of attention to making the hallways looking nice - including spare bed being in hallway all day once.
Room was at end of such hallway - but on entry struck as being bright, good-sized standard hotel room and OK. 
Restaurant in evening very unwelcoming, was wondering if open or not on first night, and on second night others came along wondering the same! Good sized meals though.
OK at breakfast time though, felt more welcoming and handy to have buffet breakfast downstairs.
But very good staff on the desk. All very helpful, making phone calls to enquire about and organising trips, advising how to get to places with printed off maps, organising taxi, etc.
Good lounge area to sit in.Although room was large and clean, this is a tired hotel in need of some attention and is a good 15 to 20 minute walk away from the city centre.Stayed here with my kids in March for 3 nights. We booked a package that included parking and breakfast. The rooms were spacious and clean with comfy beds, the breakfast was excellent and the parking conveniently located beneath the hotel in a gated garage. We walked across the street to the Space Needle and the Jimi Hendrix Experience and were just a short drive to some excellent restaurants. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the overall cleanliness of the hotel was very good. I would definitely stay here again.overall this hotel is nice. i had a king suite that was nice and bed was comfortable. very clean. across the street from the space needle and monorail. easy to go downtown via monorail or 15-20 minute walk. some coffee shops/food close by. walgreens a block or so away. capital hill or u-district requires a cab, but we just went downtown and then traveled from there by cab or bus. staff seemed a bit rushed and somewhat short, but overall fine-i really didn't need them for much beyond check-in/out. last year they were very helpful though. also-the vancouver shuttle picks up/drops off here so if you are taking that it is vry convenient. no complaints-if you're doing the tourist thing, this would be nice.Hotel doesn't look like much from the outside, and the truth is that it could use a remodel, but don't let first impressions fool you. The location is incredible - just a block and a half walk from Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, etc.), where you can spend a day or catch the monorail for a quick ride right in to the heart of downtown (stop is 3 blocks from Pike Place Market). Very family friendly and views of Seattle center are incredible! Best part of the stay though was the staff, particularly Juvy who works in the restaurant. Juvy is the kind of guy you see on the first morning interacting with other guests and wonder, ""how long have they been staying here for the staff to know them like that?"" By the time we left 3 days later, we felt like he was a long lost friend! Just a very genuinely nice guy who is incredibly helpful. The breakfast buffet is great, convenient, and very affordably, but Juvy was the best part of the morning routine!I researched the hotels in Seattle with the intent to find good value and a nice location. Being a family with teens and staying for 2 days, we wanted to have them be happy for the Seattle area. 
Our boys wanted to be in the EMP and the space needle. My Wife and I wanted to be in the Pike Place. 
I found the Best Western Plus Exceutive Inn to be in a decent area and had good value. We came from Vancouver and got in Seattle about 10pm. We were happy to be on the top floor 5 and our room is looking at the space needle. At night the needle is let so it looked really nice in our room window. There were 2 queen beds and a nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was fine with a separation of a makeup area and the bathroom. The actual shower was fine, had a curtain but all was clean. There was room safe and a RF so we were vary happy and set for our stay.
The front desk was very helpful with direction and ideas of places to eat. The Hotel has a restaurant but we did not try it. The internet room was free so we able to check email as needed. Free Wi-Fi was in the hotel but not quite reachable in our room?. 
Very happy with our stay it’s not a 5 star hotel but is in a location steps away from the needle and EMP and also steps away from the $2 downtown shuttle. The room was spacious enough for 4 and had all amenities we needed. I would highly recommend this hotel to a friend.Dad spent two nights in one room at the Best Western with three kids 18 to 24 years old. We survived. Front desk staff were friendly, check-in and check-out easy, room clean and adequate, and breakfast better than expected. Getting up two hours before the kids to shower, dress, and head to an early breakfast does help. Hotel is convenient to the Seattle Center, monorail, and Space Needle. Monorail is good way to get to the downtown and market. Parking is an extra cost. Extra charge for 4th person. Guests get 50% discount on the buffet breakfast. Morning paper is provided.
Liked the location, cleanliness, breakfast, and restaurant staff. Price is fair.
It was a $13 taxi ride (each way) to Safeco Field for the baseball game.While I did sleep well and the bed was comfortable enough, there were problems in the room such as the phone not working so I could communicate with the front desk, the light above the sink blew out as soon I as need to use it to put on my make up. The room has a damp, musty smell. Toilet flushes like it belongs inside an airplane which wakes those who are sleeping if you use it in the middle of the night. The windows are single-pane--thin from decades ago and you can hear noise from outside as if the windows were wide open. The ceilings in very low which gives it a very closed-in feeling as you navigate the hallways. 
Plusses:
The price is right--cheaper than most of the hotels around and has great access to the Seattle Center and transportation, including the Monorail.
Nice microwave, refrigerator, TV, and great snack machines down the hallway. I loved the shower head. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Friendly, efficient housekeeping staff.
Parking--you pay $15 and can park there for 24 hours while you sightsee or go to your conference for the day.Great location close to the Space Needle. And not far to walk to downtown Seattle or otherwise catch the monorail located close by. Rooms were comfortable, but not flashy. Free wi-fi, gym, spa (which came in very handy when the outside temperatures were freezing!).We stayed from April 26-28. We walked to the Seattle Center and were able to enjoy all of the activities without having to worry about parking. Our car was parked at the hotel underground gated parkade. The hotel is a half block walking distance to the center. It has great views of the space needle. There is a great workout area available just off the lobby. There is also a business center with 4 computers if you need to check email or do some internet surfing and didn't bring your own computer.
They have excellent room service and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. One time our daughter messed up the microwave and we asked for help. A service person came to the room right away. It was just a programming error and he showed us what happened. We also asked to have a room with a view and they happily switched our rooms so we could enjoy the view of the space needle...no questions asked. 
 The rooms are clean with plenty of space. We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds, there was a nice tv with hd channels. There is also a nice big chair to relax in after a long day. They have a room safe if you need to keep some important documents there. They have a coffee machine and provide you with a paper in the morning. One thing of note is that this is a green friendly hotel. The soap is available in a dispenser and they provide you with options if you don't want to participate in their green program.
There is a mcdonalds just accross the street from the hotel if you need a quick bite to eat. 
One thing you should be aware of is that they charge for parking $15+tax a night....works out to $18.60..however you are allowed to leave your vehicle there for the day. A good deal for downtown parking...It is a secure garage too...requires your room key to get through the gates.-Positives - Great location, secure parking garage, very nice fitness center, nice room with a great view of the space needle. Head waiter at breakfast bar - Juvy, was an exceptional employee! He really went out of his way to accomodate my family for breakfast even making a decaf pot of coffee upon request. He made us feel like we were at a resort rather than a hotel. Kudos to him. 
Negative- wireless internet signal reception in our room was very weak indeed. Our room was on the top floor in the corner of the building, so I'm sure it had a lot to do with it. Most hotels have wireless routers on every floor to improve reception. 
Can't complain otherwise. Our family enjoyed our stay here.[Note to Priceline & other third-party guests] Like everyone else, 3rd-party customers read reviews and have expectations; exceptional attentiveness to guest needs is what distinguishes one 2-3 star from others. Third-party prices fill otherwise unsold rooms, and provide the hotel with opportunities to sell services and win future business. My advice to Priceline customers: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet and you bought from Priceline, tell Priceline in writing; use snail mail to the company’s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I’ve found them responsive. Talk to local management directly, pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational.] 
COMMENDABLE: Exceptional central location: two blocks from the Space Needle, close to other Seattle Center theatres and monorail (which gets you to 3rd and Pine, central downtown, nearby the Public Market and all downtown. and exceptional public transportation all over Seattle. Queen Anne business district is 5 minutes away on #8 bus, only needed if walking is challenging. Big QFC market, 3 blocks; bigger (and pricier) Metropolitan Market in Queen Anne. Seniors note: Reduced fare “Orca” card, good on all busses and light rail, available at manned kiosk inside Westlake Rail Station. Paid street and lot parking nearby (expensive at hotel). There’s a Walgreens at 6th and Denny, one block. In room: one-use wrapped plastic glasses and paper coffee cups; refrigerator and microwave, excellent hot water supply; good bedding and pillows. Good and responsive below-window heat and cool control. Substitutes wall dispenser in bathroom for individual toiletries, an ""eco"" nod. Primary downtown stop for QuickShuttle bus to and from Vancouver. Hotel does not have self-service coin laundry but will direct you to “Loyal” Best Western, sister hotel 3 blocks away, for this. Working printer in business center (off lobby). I can recommend this hotel with some caveats below.
CHALLENGING: “Complimentary High Speed” internet is meaningless because system has inadequate bandwidth to serve too many users: consequence is poor download speeds and very frequent failure to open pages. Complex pages and downloads are especially troublesome with pitiful speeds (17-25 KB/sec, way below industry average. Frequent failure of door key cards; staff will tell you “your fault, demagnetized in your wallet” but unless you are carrying magnets, this is diversionary and the real issue is likely old, faulty coding equipment or door readers, both expensive to replace. Often long waits at front desk for small issues, easily solved by devising communication between staff to respond with backup when it’s busy. Non-working remote, pointed out to the (tipped) housekeeping staff but then ignored. 
TRANSPORTATION TIPS: Cars are a hassle unless you must drive through or out of city. Plan for arrival without a car: light rail from SeaTac airport, exit at Westlake (terminus) then cab from 5th and Pine--too far if you have luggage. Tip: Use “Maps” and “get directions” feature of google to reliably plan in-city transportation. At all costs avoid “GO-Shuttle Express” shared ride service from airport, utterly chaotic dispatch in terminal gets my award for worst of airport shuttles. Company does not respond to customer service issues, leaves its harried drivers and dispatch staff to field complaints, does not return calls. You’ll wait hours in the cold to be “dispatched” even if you have a (meaningless) reservation. Tip 1: take a cab if you don’t want to take rail. (GO is reviewed at transportationreviews.com. Tip 2: If you reserved, insist on a refund if they can’t dispatch you within ten minutes, and explain you'll dispute the prepaid credit charge if you are refused. Big, inexpensive buffet in hotel restaurant, breakfast only. A cab extravaganza and some good protein options. Waitstaff will rush you if you are anywhere near closing time. Be firm. Closed at lunch; dinner is tough for vegans: ask for a plain baked potato with salsa and chives, about $3.I stayed at the Best Western in Feb. Very cozy, clean, and great staff! I wanted somewhere to stay that was near downtown but was relatively inexpensive...it worked out. The restaurant was good also. Great horsradish crab stuffed shrimp! Also, the view of the Space Needle, just a block away, outside my window was fantastic.Hotel well maintained. The building is older and parking was cramped. Standing water in garage. Room was very nice and quiet.I liked that they were willing to comp the $20/day parking fee. Not happy a new employee added it on anyways by mistake, pre-authing our card for $100 or so. The parking situation here isn't very good, but I do realize this is the city.
The view ROCKED. We were on the 5th floor. Open the window, look outside, THERE is the Space Needle staring you in the face. My husband promised me Seattle and he certainly delivered! :)
We got room service. The cake was so yummy! My husband loved his Creme Brule. We ate a treat in bed while watching the very big TV.
To me the bed was hard as a rock. I don't like firm beds. My husband does. So I suppose that's a 50/50! (pssst, get softer beds!)
The couches were so pretty! (I want that green one so bad. Couldn't believe it was a pullout bed!) The room was huge and open. The showers HOT and relaxing.
The maids did fantastic work. They should be commended. The towels were always replaced and everything was fresh and clean each day.
A downside was our neighbors. Last night was the last night of our trip and the people booked in the room next to us sounded like a man, woman, and their two kids who were playing with the door that adjoins the rooms and scaring us half to death. The husband kept shouting at his wife and calling her names and belittling her while the children screamed. I felt pretty bad for the kids but wanted to smack the parents because at 5am they were still smacking their own kids. Screaming and shouting all night long and we were supposed to be out on the road three hours ago. We slept in because we were exhausted. Next stop: Butte, MT. Another 9hr drive. I hope my husband doesn't fall asleep while driving. Ugh. I didn't call the front office because I thought he'd just beat his family worse if we made a big deal out of it. Things ended on a sour note.
BUT all that said I really liked this hotel. I had a ton of fun here. So did my husband. We're a happier couple for having been here. We'll stay with Best Westerns again.I wanted to stay close to the Space Needle and was recommended to this hotel. It was about a 4 minute walk to the Space Needle. The rooms were great and hotel staff even better. The Breakfast Buffet was good as well. My son got sick at breakfast (he was fighting cold) and the wait staff was so great. I will def stay here again when I am visiting Seattle.Great hotel, located near the Space Needle and close to downtown and most tourist amenities. The service was excellent, especially Juvy in the dining room and the desk staff who helped with restaurant suggestions and directions. The rooms were good and the bathrooms were huge. I'd stay again and will recommend this to friends and family who travel to Seattle.Fiendly, obliging staff; great value breakfast; comfortable, clean rooms; ten minutes' walk from city centre; reasonable price. So what's not to like??
Thanks to all staff for a great stay.First of all, the location. So close to everything and easy walk to town, Pier 66 and Seattle Centre. The staff were helpful and the gym was good too. I recommend this hotel for others looking for an easy location to the monorail, downtown etc. This hotel is also in a nice area, and we felt quite happy walking around at night, with very little noise in and out of the hotel from traffic etc. My only complaint was that the pillows were too hard, but if that's my only complain then that's not too bad. Thanks for the stay BW!My daughter and I drove down to Seattle for a few days and had booked in to the best western. It was perfect! The staff were courteous and very helpful, when I asked if we could stay on the side of the hotel to have a view of the space needle, they didn't hesitate....they were so accomodating. The continental breakfast was amazing, such a fantastic selection, and the room was spacious & very clean. Newspaper delivered to our door each morning, and the hotel is within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. Would definitely stay here again!This was a one night stay in Seattle for the hubby and I. I was happy with the location of the Hotel, It was a block away from everything you would need or want.. We loved the view of our room ( the space needel). The room was very clean and well put together. The staff was great. The front desk guy Justin was super nice. Over all this is a great stay for the price.. We can't wait to come back and stay again..This was a great hotel for our visit. Just to visit the sky needle and Pike Street Markets. It's only a block from the sky needle and monorail to the markets. We got a special deal that included parking and breakfast. Having parking included was great. Since parking costs everywhere, having this available until 4pm on our day of checkout was a great bonus.
Breakfast was nice. Not a huge selection but certainly sufficient.
I did find the walls of the rooms quite thin. We could hear the phone in the room next to us ringing and you could hear people in the hall.
If you're looking for nightlife, there didn't seem to be much around within walking distance. We could only find MacDonalds, the hotel restaurant and a few pizza places.
Right next to the sky needle is also a mini amusement park which was great for my young daughter. We enjoyed the sky needle but didn't stay up all that long.We recieved a voucher for a free night stay in a Best Western from a BW summer promotion. We decided to use it at a Seattle hotel. We chose to go in December so we could see the city all dressed up for Christmas.We wanted a place that was central to the Seattle center and to down town. We planned to visit the Experience Music Project, the Pike Place Market and the city center during our stay. 
We stayed 2 nights at the BW Executive Inn. We booked a 2 queen, Space needle view room. The rate for the 2nd night was close to $90 which we thought was pretty reasonable considering the location. Our check in was easy and the service from the desk was informative and friendly. We even got a welcome letter from the hotel manager! The hotel was clean and the lobby nicely decorated for Christmas. Our room was clean and had the standard, nice, BW amenities ( frig, microwave, iron, hairdryer etc) The hotel is beginning to show it's age but it appeared to be clean, everything worked and it had everything we needed including a breakfast buffet ( around $7) to start our day. There is a restaurant on the premisis as well but we did not dine there. There are a few restaurants, bars, a Walgreens and a gas station mini market within a few blocks of the hotel as well. 
Parking is expensive in Seattle. Be prepared to pay $15 a night to park here too. The beauty of this hotel is the location. It's steps away from the space needle, EMP, science center, the duck ride. You can leave your car in the lot and walk or use public transportation. The hotel is just a short walk (1 block) to the Seattle center, bus stops and the monorail that takes you into town.( the monorail is fun!) Once in town you can walk, cab or bus the few blocks down to the market and water front or over to the stadiums. Be advised and prepared that the road leaving the market and back up to the monorail area is a bit steep in places if you choose to walk.
We often stay in Best Western hotels and we were very satisfied with this hotel experience. We chose this one mainly for the location and we weren't disappointed. We really enjoyed the view from our room and the proximity to the places we wanted to visit.I was in Seattle on business and this was a perfect location within walking distance of my client and the hub of downtown Seattle. It is also right next to the Monorail which runs from the Space Needle to Downtown so if walking is not your thing it is still ideal.
I run my company virtually so internet connectivity and a place to work from is important when travelling.
My hotel room was spacious and very comfortable with a nice view into town (views of the Space Needle are available in other rooms) There was reasonable sized desk and It was also equipped with a sizeable fridge and an ice machine just down the hall.
Food from the restaurant was OK and there are also a good number of takeaways that will deliver to your room.
The only negative was the speed of internet connectivity, (which I must add is FREE) I am probably spoiled with being used to speeds of up to 15MB normally so the speed here of 1-2Mb was sometimes a little frustrating. I would actually be happy to pay for a faster connectivityawesome location. tons of stuff within walking distance. nice big rooms. would stay againThis isn't the Hilton and shouldn't be expected to be. What it is is a clean, well located hotel within walking distance of the Seattle sights. Traveling to Seattle and trying to be budget conscious? Stay here.Stayed 2 nights, pre and post Cabo trip. I've stayed in hotels all over the world....from 6 stars to a mosquito enclosed cot in the Mekong Delta. Considering the price the Executive Inn is world-class. Excellent location. Hotel is very clean with large and nicely furnished rooms. Comfortable lobby and very pleasant desk staff. On future visits to Seattle this is where I will stay. Possibly the best lodging value in Seattle. So congrats to the management and staff. They are on the ball.This hotel is ideally situated near the Seattle Center. We had a gorgeous view of the Space Needle lit up at night. The room was spacious, well furnished and very clean. We were impressed at the ""green"" amenities in the room. Instead of stocking plastic bottles with shampoo, conditioner, lotion, there was a dispenser to supply all of the above. We had the choice not NOT choosing to wash linenns and towels each day, again great for the environment. Breakfast was excellent with a 50% discount on the buffet for those staying at the hotel. The bill was $15.00 for the two of us.
The staff was friendly.
And for $88.00 a night, it was an excellent value.I was able to travel to Seattle with a friend over the summer. We stayed at Best Western Executive Inn and were very satisfied with our stay. While it was not a 5 star hotel, it was clean, and our needs were taken care of in a friendly manner. The location of the hotel is wonderful for touring downtown. We were able to walk anywhere we wanted to go. I would recommend this hotel to others.if you want to stay in the heart of seattle and have the space needle in perfect view then this is the hotel. could not believe how close we were to most major sites. staff very friendly and could not fault rooms. breakfast was above average for best western hotels ( i have stayed in quite a few). would gladly recommend this hotel.We spent 2 great days here in Seattle.Everyone we came in contact with at this hotel was wonderful.Front Desk everyone was kind and courteous ,treated ""you "" like you were an important person to them.Not like ,the previous nights hotel(diferent chain),we had stayed at in Pittsburgh.
 The room was clean,the view of the Space Needle ,beautiful;didn't hear any street noise and we were there a Sat.night .Breakfast was good,nothing great,sufficient,it was basically what you would get free in some hotels(scambled egg,biscuitsgravy,toast,juice ) price $6.99 ok ,would not have paid the full price.Staff there very friendly and attentive.But you are in Seattle and prices are not what they are back home.
 Price of room was good.Close to attractions(Space Needle,monorail,Ride the Ducks)We actually rode monorail to Pikes Market,then walked to Pioneer square and walked back to hotel.It was a great place to stay.It is not a luxurious hotel,but in my opinion it deserves an excellent rating for what it is,and how they treat there guests.
 I believe management and staff make this place.
 Now was there anything I did not like to be honest.Yes there would be .Although I understand and respect the purpose for them,I did not like the soap and shampoo dispensers at all.I prefer the small idiviual soaps and shampoos.I recently booked accommodations at the Best Western Executive Inn in Seattle for my parents. I wanted a hassle free transfer and pleasant stay for them while travelling through the US headed to Vancouver. A direct flight from Toronto to Vancouver was expensive. In looking at alternatives I found a FABULOUS deal and wonderful experieince for them... at near to the same price as direct flights! Fly from Buffalo to Seattle($150/person), then a one night cruise to Vancouver from Seattle($100/person).
THE BEST IS THE FLY, STYA, CRUISE PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES pick up from the Seattle airport.. transfer to the Hotel... in the morning, after breakfast that is included, a driver returns to pick you up from the hotel and drive you to the cruise terminal. For my parents it was a fantastic way to go. For me in Toronto wondering how their travel was going it was peace of mind!
The Best Western Executive is BESIDE the space needle a walk/short taxi drive to the Pike Place Market and near the cruise terminal!
The Sales staff (specifically Patricia)... really FANTASTIC... she called, e-mailed and made sure all went well for my parents. I'm truly grateful for the service and care my parents received!
I encourage anyone to book/try the package when leaving from the Seattle Cruise Terminal... perfect way to start your journey!Room: Very clean room. Carpeting seemed new. Beds were very comfortable. The room itself was very spacious and had very minimum hallway noise. The bathroom was surprisingly clean for a BW hotel! Very surprised!
The Hotel: Front Desk was very courteous, the night staff is very courteous and gave us parking information that saved us $$$. Free newspaper every morning. Breakfast service spectacular!
Overall: As a travel agent myself, I would certainly recommend someone visiting the Seattle area to stay here, it'll save you lots plus it is convenient to many attractions. Just don't expect luxury:)My husband and I and my parents made a quick trip to Seattle and chose the Best Western Executive Inn due to location and rate. We arrived early and one of our two rooms was ready, so we checked in and relaxed for a while before dinner. We had brought a bottle of wine but forgotten a corkscrew, a problem quickly resolved by the front desk as they had one we could borrow. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
The location of the hotel is excellent - right next to Seattle Center and the Space Needle, and a short walk to Lake Union and the new Lake Union Park that has just opened. We walked to dinner at a restaurant on the lake, and then later strolled around Seattle Center. Unfortunately, the Space Needle was closed that night due to a private event or we would have gone up to see the view. 
The rooms are very large, and I was pleased to see that the little individual soaps and shampoo bottles have been replaced by dispensers - a nice ""green"" touch. Our room also had a small microwave and refrigerator.
The beds were very comfortable, and for the most part I slept well. The only negative was there was some sort of party going on nearby, and voices and laughter clearly carried through the closed windows. This was easily remedied by having the A/C running however to cover up the noise. I am not sure where the noise was coming from, whether it was somewhere else in the hotel or at a nearby club. 
Overall we had a great stay and I would happily return the next time I visit Seattle.My wife and I picked this hotel as it was close to the new cruise terminal. The hotel it self is clean and is eco friendly, the staff are great, Matt in paticular. The location is right across from the space needle with magnificent views.
Now the bad reviews, the room had tiny holes all over the walls that appeared to at one time hold pictures, the curtains had gapping holes in them, we had light bulbs burnt out, the carpet was a sea of bumps and swells as it needed to be stretched back into place. The beds were like sleeping on slab of cement.The breakfast is $6.95 per person, what I usually get for free at other Best Westerns.
Now after all this complaining would I stay here again----- if they lowered the price to around $60.00--yes, not the 143.00 I paid!!When we arrived at the airport we called the hotel and asked how they suggested we get there? They said they had an arrangement with a town car company to bring guests to the hotel for $30 for up to 4 people and that a cab would cost twice as much.
We waited 45 min for the car to come after the driver said he would be there in 5 min. When he arrived he said he had a chance for a better fare and took it knowing it would take 40 min to get back.
When we got to the hotel he charged $50 and said the clerk told us wrong. I called the clerk and asked on the speaker phone and was told $ 30 again. The driver said he was referring to another company. So I paid.
Inside the clerk said he never quoted a price. It was 12 pm and the room would not be ready until 4 pm so we stored the luggage and checked in. The rate we were quoted was on the reservation which I had and was $45 less than what he was going to charge. He changed the rate to the agreed upon rate. 
They advertise a $4.95 full breakfast buffet but charge $6.95 for one of the worst breakfasts I have ever seen. No regular coffee only decaf and it was Luke warm. No fruit. No bacon and the eggs wer cold. There is a McDonalds one block away which had a better breakfast for $3.50
Since you have a microwave and refrig in the room we bought milk and cereal at a store Longe with a coffee cake. Putting everything in the refridgerator we went sight seeing. The next morning we got the milk out and it was warm. Icalled to the front desk and said the fridge stopped working. The said I should have turned the switch back on to run it. I was never told about a switch on the fridge
The trip back to the airport in a cab cost. $32 not $60luke the clerck said. I think there must be some kickback on the town car. 
Location ok. Service ok. Communication poorbathroom shower stall hadn't been cleaned and the walls were COVERED with another woman's hair during our stay on Sept. 12 and 13. Yuch!We arrived at SeaTac on time and were picked up by the promised car service, easily accommodating the first 4 of our party, and delivered us to our waiting rooms, which were ready for us at noon. The last 4 in our party were also picked up at the airport, and delivered to their waiting room as well. The rooms were clean, spacious and the views of the Space Needle were spectacular. The hotel staff was outstanding, we were greeted by Patricia who not only met but surpassed our every need. The front desk provided us with directions to pick up last minute items at the drug store, liquor store, and even the best way to get to the monorail so we could all get to Pikes Place Market. The next morning we had breakfast, the car service dropped us off at Pier 66 to begin our Alaska cruise. I would highly recommend this hotel as would everyone in our party of 8.OK, so this isn't the fanciest place, but for us it was perfect. The decor is a little dated and the rooms could have been a little cleaner. What makes this place great is the great service and outstanding location. The front desk staff was superb at check in and when we requested extra pillows or towels, there was someone at our door within a few minutes. The location is awesome if you are a tourist in Seattle. You are right across the street from the Space Needle and Science Centre, and the walk to the waterfront is just about 10 minutes away. It's a great location without the hefty city hotel price. The breakfast was a good deal for hotel guests ($6.99 for the buffet), but we only ate there once. If you want 5 star, this isnt your place. If you want a clean comfortable location, with good service at a really good price, then pick this hotel. 
Oh, be aware of one thing; there is nightclub across the street that can be very busy on a Friday/Saturday night. That means noise, car alarms and possibly the police. If you turn on the room fan, it seems to drown out the noiseOnly block and a half from Seattle Center, Space Needle, a Hop On Hop Off stop, monorail. Very accommodating hotel staff, desk, maids. Clean, comfortable rooms. Free internet, business center. Extensive breakfast buffet, discount price for guests.We stayed here for two nights in July. We liked this place a lot. The location is fantastic. Just far enough away from downtown so that we weren't paying 300.00 a night but still very convenient to the action. This hotel is right across the street from the Space Needle and on our first afternoon we took in the Needle and walked down to the waterfront for dinner and some wandering. The monorail leaves from the Needle and goes right into the heart of downtown for 5.50 for our family of four. The downtown bus service is free during certain hours, so they really make sure that this town is visitor friendly! Back to the hotel. The front desk staff were very courteous and helpful. The lobby is very tastefully decorated as are all of the common areas. The spaces are very clean and the rooms were very clean as well. The linens were very nice and of good quality. The rooms were very nice and spacious and well appointed with free high speed and HBO. They have a restaurant that offers a lovely breakfast buffet for 6.95 per adult and free to the kids. Great value! The only wrinkle was the fee for parking but as I understand this is pretty much the norm in Seattle so not really a big deal. It certainly wouldn't deter me from staying here again or telling my friends and family .This was a great Best Western! Large room with all the ammenities. View of the Space Needle from our room. Desk clerk was very helpful and held our bags while we looked around Seattle before our Alaskan Cruise. Breakfast was very good at a small charge. I really liked the ""green"" measures they have taken with this hotel.We had a hard time finding a hotel in Seattle. Our first choice would have been Silver Cloud Lake Union but they were booked. I called five or six other hotels and they were also booked solid. 
There are plaster anchor devices in the wall that must have held pictures and should have been covered over. I mentioned to the front desk there was a breakfast tray that had been left in the hall since the morning. The chair in the room has soil marks on it. We paid $135.00 plus tax for this room. 
On the positive side, it is within walking distance to the Space Needle, Ride the Ducks and the Science Fiction museum
They offer a breakfast buffet for half-price to hotel guests -- $6.95.We stayed two nights as part of a trip to see the Yankees play the Mariners at Safeco Field. The room was good: quiet HVAC system, adequate sound privacy, microwave, fridge and coffee-maker, clean and comfortable. Buffet breakfast ($6.95 pp) was a cut above the usual. Parking ($15) was less than at downtown hotels and the room rate ($123) was reasonable. Staff were friendly and helpful.
Best of all, the location was great for our purposes. As Seniors we paid $1.75 each way to Safeco (plus an easy 10-minute walk) via monorail from the Space Needle (5 minutes walk) and light rail from the Westlake Center. Other attractions were equally accessible.
Overall, a wise choice.I stayed at the Executive Inn the night before embarking on a Royal Caribbean cruise from nearby Pier 91. The Executive Inn is a block away from McDonald's and two blocks away from the Space Needle and monorail. The Executive Inn was a good value for the location, and I was able to walk over from the monorail station after taking the LINK from the airport to Westlake Mall and then transferring onto the monorail at Westlake.
The only problem I had with the motor inn was the noise. The people in the room next door to me had their tv blasting away at 10 P.M. while I was trying to sleep. They were so loud that I could hear every word they were saying. At one point, the woman asked her male companion to turn down the tv so that she didn't ""need to shout over it"". She needn't have bothered, he didn't turn it down, and she was so loud, he didn't need to. My husband managed to fall asleep despite the noise only to be woken up at 10:15 P.M, when someone knocked on our door. They went away before we could see who it was. You could also hear toilets flushing through walls, and loud talking from guests getting off the nearby elevator. There is a fire station nearby, so you can also hear when they respond to calls. There were also plumbers who were talking outside the hotel at 4:00 A.M. before driving off, and the trash dumpsters were serviced at 5:40 A.M.
To the hotel's credit, I did receive a response to my complaint's about the noise mentioned in a hotel survey I completed. I was asked if I complained about the loud tv/talking next door, (I did not), and management promised to address the noise problems at future meetings. When I had encountered a loud tv previously at my stay in another hotel, I had complained, and security told me after responding to the complaint that the room was found to be empty with just the tv blasting which they then turned off- end of problem. Since there were two people in the room next door this time, and they were well aware that the tv was too loud, I didn't see the point in complaining, but at least it is nice to know that the hotel management probably would have told them to turn it down had they been asked.
I recommend this hotel with reservations. If you plan to stay out sightseeing late and don't plan on going to bed until midnight anyway, or if you are a heavy sleeper, then the noise issues probably won't be a concern. For guests like me who are taking cruises from Pier 91, take the #24 bus to the pier rather than the hotel's town car (cost is $2 for the bus, $8 for hotel's town car, pp).It was a pretty last minute decision to drive down here from Vancouver so we didn't have any hotels booked for the night. Best Western saved us from the potentially disastrous night over its neighbor Travelodge. We were going to settle for the latter but thank goodness we didn't. For a lower price, Best Western made our night a lot happier than we would've been.
We arrived to the hotel around 1 am pretty ticked off that we couldn't find a decent hotel within our budget. Kathryn greeted us and had found us a wonderfully spacious room - 2 queen beds with a clear view of the Space Needle! We were even given a discount for being a Costco member, that's a first! I loved how we were allowed to keep our car in the gated parking garage until 6pm, that allowed us to take the Monorail the next day.
The room was clean, and the beds were comfy. The shower pressure was perfect and water was hot enough. I honestly can't say anything bad about this hotel. From the moment you step in, everything looked well kept and managed. Even in the restaurant, the manager took his time to greet customers and help out the staff. The breakfast was $5 for hotel guests but it was well worth every penny! You can eat cereal, eggs, sausages, potatoes, danishes, DIY waffles, and so much more
The location was only 2 blocks from the Space Needle, and it allowed us to get to Nordstrom and Macy's very easily by the Monorail ($2 oneway). This would definitely be my first choice of stay when driving down again.
Please thank Kathryn for us for her wonderful service at the desk, and Jonathan for his kind help in the restaurant.The Space Needle is across the street, the Duck Tour terminal and monorail are adjacent. Its a little away from the tourist hubbub but the Pike Street Market is an easy ten minute walk. This hotel is perfectly located. 
Room was spacious, clean and quiet. Checkin was courteous and efficient. Tiny but fast Computer centre in lobby. Excellent in-room WiFi.
While breakfast is not included, the $5 discounted and abundant buffet at the adjacent restaurant is a wonderful value. Only negative: one of the two elevators was offline and there were no stairs. Long waits were irritating but could happen at any small hotel.We stayed here for 2 nights while visiting friends and sightseeing in Seattle. I had looked at rates online before we arrived at the hotel and found a low (around $65 per night) rate for a non-view room. At check in I pulled out all my travel discount id's (AAA, Best Western Gold Crown Platinum, government employee) and was told a higher rate than listed on the Best Western website. I told them we were on a budget and didn't need a view and they immediately honored the online rate.
Lo and behold, when we got to our ""non-view"" room we had an excellent view of the Space Needle and EMP! We went out for the evening and when we came back there was a handwritten note from the manager thanking us for choosing their hotel and there was a complimentary cheese and fruit platter in the minifridge. 
The complimentary breakfast in the hotel is excellent, the best I have ever had at a Best Western. Staff were kind and helpful. You can't beat the location if you plan to visit the Space Needle and surrounding area - it's a one block walk. There's really nothing bad I can say about this hotel!For staying downtown I was able to book this for ~80/night and was pleased with the experience. Ok for that low of price expect rooms that are clean, some road noise but not bad and a dated lobby. Take the light train (40 minutes) from the SeaTac airport for $2.75, then either take the monorail (check times) for an additional $2.00 or a nice 15 minute walk versus their town car at $40.00 or a Taxi at $45.00. Remember this is Seattle so rain is a factor. Easy walking distance to Pike Pl and pier 66 and it is across the street from the Spaceneedle (sunset was super the day I was there).We stayed in this inn with my friends overnight, bed was comfortable, room was clean and spacious. It took us 15-20 mins. To walk to reach this place from greyhound bus depot- not bad for us as we love walking. We tried there breakfast buffet as it is not included in our package it only cost $ 4.95 each person-lots of variety to choose and food was good. The location of this inn was spot on as it is near to Space needle, Seattle center, monorail, Pacific science center, Denny Park and Pike market.Booked this hotel based on the location (near Key Arena) although was a bit skeptical because of the mixed reviews. I was relieved that overall the hotel was fine, clean, friendly helpful staff. The hotel is a but old and could use some updates (new carpet, furniture) but overall was fine - although nothing fancy or overdone, just the basics.
I was impressed that they had recyling bin in the room and eco-friendly soap/shampoo dispensers in bathroom and shower. Nice to see the effort.
Excellent location - quick walk to the space needle, monorail, or key arena.Stayed for two nights after travelling down from Canada. Choose this hotel for it's location at Seattle Centre and wasn't disappointed. Literally a two minute walk to Seattles most famous landmark and other facilities and attractions. Was abit of a walk to the downtown area but enjoyed the monorail ride from Seattle centre to downtown. All in all and excellent hotel considering the price, whilst visiting a city like Seattle you won't be spending much time in the room and a hotel with a location like this one is perfect. Would stay here againWhat a great hotel, I'd stay there again and recommend this hotel 100%. 
Great value, clean, good location, amazing staff. The staff understand the true meaning of customer service, I can not stress this enough. 
Kyle and the rest of the front desk staff went out of their way to accommodate us. 
The breakfast was yummy, in fact I'd say those were the best waffles I've had in my life! 
We will for sure be back.There are two remarkable things about this hotel, first is location. It's a block away from the space needle. Right in the middle of belltown, close to denny park. You can walk from the light rail at westlake to the hotel in about ten minutes. I was able to get from the airport to the hotel on the light rail in about an hour and for $2.50 which rules.
The other big thing is the breakfast. It rules. Make your own waffles, hot entrees that are actually fresh, fresh fruit, good coffee, and all kinds of pastries. I've had a lot of free breakfasts in my travels and this one is easily the best. Way to go. I'll come back just for the breakfast.
As for the room, it's a bit old school but that's ok. It's got a tv with lots of channels and a shower with hot water, that's all I really need.This is the first hotel my husband and I stayed during our week-long visit in the Pacific Northwest. We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on the Thanksgiving weekend. We like this hotel because many restaurants and the Space Needle are within 5~10 minute walking distance; we also walked to Pike Place Market and the Seattle Waterfront that are several blocks away (~20 minutes walk). 
The room is clean, although the bedspread looks a bit old; there is a microwave and a refrigerator in the room which may add more convenience; but we did not use them. The hot breakfast buffet is very good and is complimentary, with hot sausages, eggs, etc., and you can make your own waffles on the Waffle iron, in addition to choices of bread, yogurt, fruits, etc. The internet access in the room is free and very convenient. We paid $15/day for parking at the hotel parking garage, which seems to be typical for hotels in downtown Seattle. 
The heater/air-conditioner is a bit of noisy so we had to turn it off before we sleep - that can make it a little cold at night because there is only a blanket on each bed, in addition to the bedspread, which did not seem to provide enough of warmth if the heater is off when you sleep. It would be good if each room has an extra blanket or two, in case the guest may need it. 
We booked this hotel with Priceline by naming our own price and got a very good deal. For the price we paid, we are very happy with what we got at this hotel. The front desk staff were nice and helpful for checking-in and -out. The staff at the hotel restaurant/bar was also very nice when we asked for help. Our overall experience with this hotel is good and satisfactory.Left the hotel without the GPS and got lost. Called the hotel and the Asst General Manager, Ian, was EXCELLENT! He stayed on the telephone with us until we reached the hotel. This may not sound like much, but if you happen to be the one lost it means a great deal, especially if you're going to be late for a concert. In fact the entire staff was great, always greeting us with a smile. Hotel was clean, comfortable (love the fireplace in the lobby) and located right next to the Seattle Center. They say location is everything and that may be true but so is Customer Service and this hotel has both.We live in Vancouver and frequently visit Seattle for an overnight visit. We have never stayed downtown before. That will be changing thanks to this hotel. The staff was extremely professional and curteous but at the same time made you feel like you were an old friend returning home. A great feeling for a first time guest. Our room was a nice size with a comfortable king size bed and nice and clean. Breakfast was nicely set up in the restaurant downstairs and was more than ample. Hot waffles, biscuits and gravy, cereal, scrambled eggs, toast, juce, coffee etc. 
The location is perfect. Within walking distance from anywhere in downtown Seattle that you would want to visit and literally right across the street from the Space Needle. It would be about a 15 minute walk to Pike Place Market - so allthough there is lots of underground parking at the hotel - you would not necessarily need your car for the duration of your visit. The hotel is also within walking distance of our favourite Italian Restaurant LaVita E Bella (2411 2nd Ave) We will definately be returning here again!!The hotel in Seattle was inviting and accommodating. The only thing I would recommend is bringing your own pillow...the one's provided were small and lumpy and provided no neck support. The hotel could use an update in the rooms...wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom, and the carpet was a bit dingy. 
The breakfast was a nice surprise which was included in the price...a full menu including a waffle station. The hotel location was just steps away from the Monorail station and Science fiction museum. It was very close to many attractions, including the Pike Place Market. 
Upon arrival, the front desk informed us to park underground which was great, but did not say that there was a charge for the parking. When checking out the next day, they waved the parking fee since it was unexpected.
I would stay here again if they updated their rooms a bit more and provided better pillows. The location alone was enough to be satisfactory.Let me first say I read all the reviews prior to staying and had some reservations about staying at the Best Western Executive Inn, but i am very glad we stayed here. Never ran into a person who was not friendly, quite the opposite. After i booked my reservation I called the hotel to inquire about the best way to get to the hotel from the airport and the Front desk offered to get me a towncar for $40 versus the cab ride(with infant with us we didn't want to take public tyransportation) which would have been the same price. Now it took 40 minutes from when we informed the car service we were ready at and 3 calls to them for them to finally get us, but that would not be thehotels fault. When we went to check in the girl at the front desk was very friendly and our room was ready to check in at noon. When we walked in to our room it was much nicer than expected at a great view of the space needle. I couldn't imagine staying in and not getting a space needle view room, its a must!! 
My only negative thing I would say about the hotel is that you can hear into the room next to you if the people next too you are noisy, but that happens at a lot of hotels. 
The General manager brian and his staff were nothing but great. I had called in advance to have jewlery shipped to the hotel and he held it in his safe for me and he went out of his way to make sure our experience was memorable and it was. I just cant see were some prevous revierers say the service was ""horrible"" and"" the worst"". I would 100% stay here again!!!!!We booked the room directly over the phone, thought we were getting a pretty good rate (senior), did not know the parking was $15 a day on top of that until chekcing in ! ! Front desk clerk (Ed) was courteous and helpful in directions on map where we needed to go. Going in to the room.. curtains were open to display a dirty window, the ottoman was upside down, popcorn in the air conditioner grate, there was ONE coffee packet and no coffee cups - - got more from front desk. Kleenex dispenser was empty - - I stole one from the cleaning cart. The ""green"" effort is great - - however TWO bath towels, TWO hand towels and TWO facecloths - - good thing there were only the two of us. However.. I don't like to use my hand towel for my hair (don't do it at home) - - but when I brought these issues to the attention of the desk clerk, he informed me that I could have got another towel, and will inform the management/housekeeper about the rest. The ""rating"" or comment card from previous guest was still on the desk - - with not too favorable comments as well.
The restaurant was pretty good for our evening meal and breakfast. Convenient to the Space Needle and park.First time stay at this Best Western. No problems checking in. I believe the official check-in time is 4:00 pm, but we were in our room by 2:30 pm. We knew ahead of time about the $15.00/day parking fee. While it is becoming standard practice in most city hotels these days, we did think that this was high in price - given the fact that there does not seem to be on-site security, such as in a secured parking lot. But, we were prepared.
We were in a second story room in the back. Very quiet. Very spacious room. It was very hot during our stay and the efficient air conditioner was much appreciated. Everything was clean. There was a fridge and micro. There were not enough towels when we arrived. Requested a couple of extra bath towels and they were brought up quite quickly.
The free hot breakfast was good. On one of the mornings, there was biscuits and gravy, which was quite a novelty as a breakfast dish for us Canadians. Scrambled eggs were good. It was nice to have a variety of beverages to choose from. One daughter was just pleased that you had cereal! 
We did eat in the hotel restaurant for one supper. We were hoping to have the $12.95 meals, which were displayed in the menu at the front counter. But that same afternoon they actually changed the menu. Menu is okay. Not so varied and a bit more expensive now. We did have great service from the staff.
The only thing that I would have changed was to have 2 people on the front desk in the mornings (we were there around 9:30 am). Between people checking out, some even checking in and various phone calls, the woman at the front desk was having trouble keeping up, but she kept trying and was polite to everyone. There were at least 2 people in the afternoon, so it would be nice to have the same in the mornings. The front desk staff were very helpful overall. We asked 2 different people about directions and restaurants and followed there advice and got exactly what we wanted.This was the last stop on a week long family vacation. After outstanding service and hotels throughout Oregon including a stop at another Best Western, we were expecting a nice night to complete our vacation. Nothing could have been further from the truth with this place. Having stayed a numerous Best Western hotels throughout Canada and the US, I expected a certain level of service and amenities. The front desk staff are not interested in their guests and in fact made us feel like they were doing us a favour. 
After finally getting to our floor (the elevators are beyond slow and no stairs to be found), the hallway was dark, dingy and certainly not up to the level that would be expected from a Best Western. The room doors are beat up and look dirty, the ceiling is low and the hallways are dark. The room was clean although it has certainly seen better days. As there are few restaurants in the area, we decided to eat at the restaurant. The food was good although overpriced, the young lady who ""greeted"" us could not have been less interested in her job. Our server was very nice and service was prompt. 
Following dinner, I returned to our car to get something. On the way back, it was almost comical with the length of time it took to get into an elevator - people were left waiting for another car...again no stairs in sight. In the hallway, things went from bad to worse...a disgusting bug of some nature was wandering in the hall, which I killed...still wonder how many more there were!
We had booked a room with 2 queen beds, which should indicate that a number of people may be staying in the room. The coffee maker in the room comes with enough coffee for 1 cup. Unless of course someone wants decaf. So at most, there were would be 2 cups of coffee. 
The complimentary breakfast was among the most unappealing we experienced on our trip. The water in the scrambled eggs should have been a tip-off but I still took some, one bite was more than enough. With one staff member for a 4th of July weekend, finding a clean spoon became an epic adventure and again very little interest was shown in meeting the needs of the guests. 
Upon check-out, the young lady at the desk was completely unable to meet the basic level of customer service. At no time did she ask if my stay had been okay or any other interest in our impressions. Following a very silent transaction, she did not thank us for our business or even wish us a good trip. 
The location of this hotel is good for the Space Needle and another attractions. However, I wish I had checked out the Travelodge or Holiday Inn that are very nearby. I will NEVER visit this hotel again and will actually think twice about using the Best Western brand.After arriving in Seattle at then end of a drive across the state, I called the hotel around 1400 to check to see if early check in would be possible. If not, we would just drive down to the waterfront and do through the aquarium. We were told by the hotel employee that she could not answer that over the phone, we need to go in to find out the answer.
 I realize that the answer to this question has several different variables: room availability, company policy, etc. However, we had traveled across the state with two kids and were just asking if it would be possible. I would have been happy to check in later. Once we arrived, we were checked in by the same individual that we had just spoken with. We were behind another couple that was checking in and I overheard the employee provide instructions to the couple ahead of us. After checking in, we were told that there was a daily parking charge of $15, which while somewhat reasonable, was not advertised at the time of the reservation. The unnamed employee (no nametag visible) then offered assistance to the next people in line to check in. At which point, I asked where the parking was. I received a blank look in return. After getting that it was below the building, I went to park my car. Now, I must comment that the parking garage leaves a LOT to be desired. The two handicapped spots that are next to the elevator are only marked for compact vehicles. I do not drive a compact vehicle. I can accept existing parking garage design restrictions prevent ideal parking spaces. I can also acknowledge that while they might meet the letter of the law for American with Disabilities Act, it does not make it convenient in any way. I was able to locate a parking spot further away from the elevator. But that presented a problem in itself. When my wife tried to bring the luggage cart to the car, she couldn’t. The parking structure had a height restriction of 6 foot. The cart was taller than 6 foot. I was able to tilt the cart over and drag it through this height restricted area because it was empty. But, once loaded with our luggage, I could no longer perform this feat. I will point out that you can go around the parking garage to the other side where the height restriction allows the cart to pass through loaded. However, as previously mentioned, I am handicapped and walking any distance is rather difficult.
 Walking into my room was like hitting a wall of cheap cologne. I don’t know if the smell was supposed to cover up a more foul stench, or if it was from the previous occupant. Either way, it was rather unpleasant, if not survivable. I proceeded to sit in the nice comfy chair only to find out that all the comfy qualities of said chair were worn out. The arms of the char were not nicely padded, instead the wood frame wound up digging into my arms. Sense I was on my long awaited vacation, I figured that I would make the best of things. I then took off my shoes and socks, I like walking around barefoot on carpet. It’s a small guilty pleasure after having my foot in and out of casts for four years. I walked across the room to splash some water on my face only to find that my feet stuck to the carpet with every step. I put my socks back on.
 Jump ahead to my shower experience. I will acknowledge that your hotel has “Gone Green,” and while the shower head might be eco friendly, it is not person friendly. A high pressure, low volume nozzle is more fitting in a C&C environment, not in a shower. I found that the extra time spent trying to rinse off countered any water saving qualities that the shower head offers.
 The Elevators are smooth if not very slow. I am sure that this is a constant complaint, but let me address this. While waiting for the elevators, after several minutes, I began to look around for the stairs. I saw on the wall next to the elevators a sign indicating in case of a fire, use the stairs. Great sign, really useful to those that are unaccustomed to elevators, however, I saw no signs as to where these stairs were. Now, up until now I have talked about comfort features. This is a real safety issue. On day two, I was talking to another hotel patron about the long wait for the elevator. He mentioned to me that there are stairs at both ends of the hall, but they do not go down to the lobby. The stairs apparently only lead to the outside. For being an eco friendly hotel, not providing the option for stairs instead of the elevator seems a little short sighted. I know that this addresses a structure issue and not one easily overcome without major building modifications.
 I can say that the room had a very nice view of the Space Needle and was conveniently located next to the EMP, Space Needle, and the Pacific Science Center. But the hotel description fails to mention the fire station that must reside next to it. Between the sirens going off all night and the people running screaming down the hall, I found it really rather difficult to get any sleep. I will take the blame for not reporting the screamer to the front desk. By that time, I had pretty well given up on sleep and found it a distraction from the sirens.
 The four days and three nights that we spent in this hotel sounds more like a comedy of errors that the tragic experience that it was. When I spend my vacation time and my money on a hotel room, I expect far more that what I received. That being said, the experience was not a complete waste. After having spent my vacation in this hotel, I have absolutely no desire to stay in any other Best Western hotel again. If asked by family, friends or coworkers, I would not recommend this hotel.Comfortable beds and great pillows, the decor in the room was a bit tired in need of a face lift. Reception staff were helpful, location was handy right where the shuttle from Vancouver arrives and departs which was handy. Close to the Needle. Ok restaurant, bar attendant was great, gave us some handy advice on sightseeingFirst let me say I like this hotel and I recommend it. I just want to first point out a few weird things about my room. When I checked in and went to my room there was a plate of leftover scrambled eggs sitting right outside my door (see the pics). It stayed there for over 5 hours, even though when I checked in there were cleaning carts nearby, and 5 hours later a guy was vacuuming right outside the room. Did none of them see the plate?? Also I went to turn a doorknob and it came off in my hands (see the pic). Those are my only complaints.
Now on to all the praise:
Big room, free high speed wifi, big 27"" TV, very close to the Space Needle and everything over in Seattle Center including the monorail, the Experience Music Project, and the Science Fiction museum. I could see all these things from my window. They are very big into recycling and being green here, which is good, there is even a recycle bin in the room. Oh, the local news station has a helicopter on their roof right across the street which seems to take off a lot, but I understand that is not the hotel's fault. Just pointing out you may hear a lot of helicopter noise. Back to the praise: fridge and microwave in room, restaurant in hotel, large couch, easy chair with ottoman, high back leather chair and desk, powerful Oxygenic shower head in shower, etc. etc.
I highly recommend this hotel, they just need to pay attention to cleaning and maintenance issues a little bit better.Hotel staff was friendly. I am a Best Western Employee and was shocked when I got a room with an awesome view of the Space Needle at the employee price! Parking was about 15 dollars- which we thought was a little steep. The rooms are decent enough, but you can tell the building is very old. We liked the recycling bin in the room. A smart idea that more hotels should put into practice.This hotel is a great bargain for those visiting Seattle. It is a VERY short walk to the Seattle Center where you can find the Space Needle, Experience Music Project, Science Fiction Museum and the monorail to downtown. I highly recommend this hotel for those traveling on a budget or with kids. The free breakfast is HOT and includes niceties like waffles and real orange juice. We paid extra for a room with a view of the space needle, it was worth it. There is also parking under the hotel that is very secure. We will visit this hotel again. 
One word of caution: There is an underage nightclub on the corner, noisy teens start arriving at 10PM weekends. I suggest a higher floor or ear plugs if that noise will bother you.If you are traveling with a group of students to Seattle, stop looking for a place to stay because this is it. The Best Western Executive Inn is located directly next to the Space Needle and the city's monorail system. The monorail gives large groups access to the Seattle downtown without the excessive costs of bussing at virtually all times of the day. The proximity of the Space Needle keeps the surrounding area safe at all times of the day, and the hotel itself is well-lit and nicely maintained. The interior of the hotel has a small but comfortable lobby, as well as a full-service restaurant and bar, while the rooms themselves are spacious and very clean. The restaurant offers an incredible daily breakfast to large groups that includes: eggs, roasted potatos, sausage, waffles, bagels, pastries, a variety of cereals, juices, fresh fruit, coffee and tea that is far better than I have had at many more ""high-end"" locations. Beyond this, because of the variety of options, this breakfast is uniquely suited to the finicky appetities of younger travelers, and thereby ensures that all in your group will be equally satisfied. Most importantly, the staff at the Executive Inn is just superb. Knowing how large groups can often require additional attention to make sure that all needs are met, the staff at Best Western is always ready to do what is necessary to ensure that your group gets what they need to be comfortable and satisfied. This willingness to positively work with groups to keep things going smoothly makes things beeter for your group, and consequently all of the other guests in the hotel as well. In short, the central location of this hotel, the easy access it provides to the downtown area, the cleanliness of the accomodations, the great breakfast afforded to their guests, and the hospitality of the staff make this the perfect place to stay if you are bringing a group to Seattle. Stop looking, and give them a call, you'll be glad you did.I saw one reviewer mention an uptight concierge. I think I know who you mean. I think she was just being civil, clearly should not be desk staff. The other desk staff members were very cordial and would make suggestions when I had a question as to getting to the airport, what to eat, where to go, and so on. The lobby area has a nice fireplace area and tons of travel literature. 
When I checked out the breakfast buffet, it was quite ample. I must have come at a bad time because there were no staff on duty and lots of tables were not bussed. Also they were out of coffee. This was not the case the next day, so perhaps a fluke. 
The elevator is pretty clunky. The door closes slowly and should be repaired or made to be smoother. 
The room was great and eco-friendly. Recycling is encouraged. The bathroom area has lotions, shampoo and conditioner in dispensers rather than little bottles. This is great for the hotel especially from guests who like to rip off bottles. Probably saves money for them, certainly. 
I heard mention of homeless. Well, they're in every city, and to criticize the hotel for a city problem is not fair. If you're city smart they usually are not a problem. 
I also appreciated the follow-up call from the Best Western staff to ensure I had a good stay. 
Proximity to the Monorail and the Space Needle and museums was also perfect.This hotel gets and ""average/ok"" rating from me.
Staff on the whole were friendly enough, though not the standard expected when staying or visiting somewhere in the USA. 
There was one particular woman on receiption we nicknamed PPMT (Permanent PMT), none of the staff wore name badges so I can't name her, but she was in her 20's with short blond(ish) bobbed hair, she was rude, short conversationalist and just downright customer unfriendly. The girlfriend of one of my friends who stayed with us, rung from home and also complained to us about her and her attitiude. She described her attitude perfectly to us and it couldn't have been anyone else. There were times we thought that it was a bad day, but no the 3 times we saw her there, she was the same!!
Anyway, the hotel is an okay. The rooms are pretty standard though the walls pretty thin, in fact we were able to do tap on our friends wall in the room next to us if we wanted them instead of ringing, and were able hear one of our friends snoring too!!
The windows are too thin also, our cheaper rated hotel room didn't have a view of the space needle, so I only assume that the windows are thicker for the richer guests. I say this because every morning, whether you like it or nor you get woken up in the morning by he sound of TWO HELICOPTERS. They come from the local TV news buildings, Komo 4 news, and another news broadcaster that I can't remember the name of. Added with this is almost constant noise from police, fire and ambulance sirens. In the end I bought ear-plugs and slept very well - this is a tip to be highly receommended!!
A small gripe from an ""international"" visitors point of view, is that the TV had no international TV stations, there is around 80 to choose from and not one is world news, for example BBC World or CNN International.
This is as i say a small gripe, as you can use the internet for free in the ""business center"" which is just a very small room with two computers in it, if you want to catch up on things back home etc.
The breakfast buffet is also ok, though after staying there for 6 days (we used the hotel as a base for different excursions), it was became samey. 
Your selection is potato wedges, chippolatas, scrambled egg (which was also square shaped as though it literally had just come out of can), waffles, 2-3 choices of cereal and oatmeal, bananas, 3 juices and tea and coffee.
Good points are that's it is VERY close to the Space Needle (which itself is over rated as we later found out that you can go up the Columbia Center building in downtown which is 75 floors up instead of 42! and gives better panoramic views). The space needle has a monorail whoch connects you to downtown within 2-3 minutes and a return trip for $4 it's not a bad way of travelling into to the city. 
The hotel has friendly bar staff and, rarely for a hotel (I think), a pool table which was frequented by us a couple of times. 
Best of all for us, was that it was near to a great bar called SPORT, and as the name suggests it's a sports bar with the friendliest bar staff you can meet, what a find that was. Good food too, and just a two minute walk from the hotel.
The car park, despite the critism I've read is very secure, ok you have to pay for the parking space, but I'd much rather have to do that than leave it outdoors. We saw two men forcing money out of the parking meters in the car park opposite one morning, and no doubt they had a look around the cars in the car park to see anything valuable was on display before raiding the machines!!
I'd come back and stay again, I think, but will be bringing my ear-plugs and stab-proof vest with me next time, in case I dare to walk more than 5 minutes away from the hotel and space needle.We were vacationers from Vancouver, Canada and the following are my summarized thoughts of the hotel:
Pros:
1. The location was perfect since it was just a block or two away from the Needle.
2. The room was clean, no foul odor. 
3. The staff were polite and helpful.
4. Buffet Breakfast was complimentary and ample.
5. Free 30 mins. local calls
6. Eco-friendly utilities
Cons:
1. The bath tub didn't have a hand shower.
2. Certain sections of the hotel have faded / old wall and floor decor.
3. The parking was not free, even if there was plenty available. We were hoping that this was free, but they charged us anyway.
4. The in-room heating/cooling system is very old.I had three nights to spend in Seattle and wanted to stay fairly close to downtown. I almost always go through that Website where you can ""Name Your Own Price"" (can't mention it by name here or they won't post this) to get the best rate possible on a top-tier hotel, but since I was traveling alone and was on a tight budget this time, I decided to go with a mid-range property. I bid $50 at the 2-and-a-half-star level and the Executive Inn accepted my offer. I booked it for just one night because I wasn't sure what to expect and didn't want to risk getting stuck in someplace unacceptable for my entire stay.
I realized the evening of my arrival that I'd be getting in really late, and I called them to let them know; the front desk agent was super nice and did a great job giving me directions. When I got there (around 3 am) I parked on the street. Check-in was fast and easy and he comped me a parking pass for the hotel garage because of the late hour, which saved me from either paying $15 or getting up by 8 to feed the meter.
I got to the room and found it to be large and clean with a refrigerator and microwave. I was dead tired but impressed enough with the value that I fired up my laptop and used the free Wi-Fi to ask Capt. Kirk to bid on another night at the same rate --which was accepted -- before going to bed.
I got up in time to hit the free breakfast buffet and was blown away by the selection: lots of hot items (scrambled eggs, potatoes, link sausages, make-your-own waffles), bagels, yogurt, several kinds of cold cereal, a selection of fruit juices and decent local name-brand coffee. The plates and bowls are disposable (think Chinet) and so are the kind-of-flimsy utensils, but it's all compostable and what isn't composted is recycled.
So if being environmentally conscious is important to you, this is a great place to stay. There are recycling bins in every room and the vanities and showers have dispensers for soap, shampoo, conditioner and moisturizer rather than individual packages. And while some might say the property ""needs a little updating"", not ripping out fixtures and finishes every few years is an earth-friendly approach.
Ultimately, I was happy enough to book a third night too. I switched rooms after the first night to get an even-numbered room on an upper floor with a western exposure and a great view of the Space Needle which is a couple of blocks away. The odd-numbered rooms have a ""city view"", but it's more alley than skyline.
The Executive Inn may not be elegant or trendy, but it's clean and I found all the staff to be friendly and helpful. I'ts not someplace I'd book for a special occasion or stay with someone I wanted to impress, but otherwise I'd definitely stay there again if I could get a bargain rate like that. There's a great message board where you can get tips on how to bid on hotels, rental cars, etc.; again, I can't mention it by name but search for ""where we learn to make travel affordable"" and you'll find it.My family and I stayed at this motel and it is a nice place to stay. Very clean, excellant breakfast and friendly staff. If you plan on walking or taking the public transportation watch for homeless people there is a lot of riff raff in the surrounding area. A teenage club directly across the street from the hotel.The location is great- close to the city center, right by the Expo in Belltown (monorail, Space Needle and EMP). Great view of the Space Needle. And the price is reasonable, including the parking.
The free breakfast buffet was really good, and the attached restaurant & bar is nice.
The night staff was pretty lax, though. While I checked in, the three lobby staff never interrupted a three-way conversation behind the desk about their weekend plans. It's a little thing, but it reflects a certain lack of ""professionalism."" The night desk also never gave me a promised callback regarding the lack of WiFi in my room, and never passed a message about it to the daytime desk.
The daytime desk staff was much more courteous and responsive, though. They referred me to the WiFi provider directly (who were ultimately still unable to get me online, probably due to a fault with my laptop).
As someone else noted in a review, there seems to be no procedure at the hotel for clearing used room service trays from the hallways. There was a discarded tray with meal remnants outside a door on our floor when we checked in that remained there for over 24 hours (the cleaning staff just ignored it the next day, because it was still there the following evening after our room had been cleaned.)
For $15-a-day parking, I'd also like to see more security on the parking garage. It has a locking gate with cardkey access, but the gate is never closed. Since hotel guests all have room cardkeys, I would think it would be easy to use the security gate to restrict access to the garage.Deceptive front desk staff, claiming ""you cannot park on the street between 10pm and 4am"" ... in order to try and get you to pay the $15 parking fee with them. This is completely not true. Parking is free in Seattle on the street between 6pm and 8am.
They even put deceptive signage on the outside of the building facing the street, saying ""no parking between 10pm and 4am""... but this is wrong. It is a public street, and falls under the same Seattle bylaws. Locals seem to know this and park there anyway to go to a nearby late-night club. 
Anyway, save your money and park on the street (plenty of free space in this area), or stay at the Travel Lodge next door which offers free parking.
As for room...the ""organic fresh odor neutralizer"" stuff they use is nauseously overpowering. Any attempts by them to be ""eco-friendly"" were lost on us, as we had to blast the heat with the window wide open in order to try and aerate the room. 
Other than that, only minor complaints. It sucks that the room key is one big advertisement for some pizza company, and that there is advertising and overbearing signage in the room, but I guess this is to be expected for a major chain.I stayed there in September. The bed was hard as a rock. It was like sleeping on planks of wood. The only saving grace is that my room had a lovely view of the Space Needle. I pre-booked and paid for two nights, but was so fed-up and disappointed that I left a day early. They wouldn't give me my money back for the unused second night. They said that I would have to do that when I returned back to Australia.
I was also disappointed and extremely surprised that they didn't have Room Service.Tired looking hotel and room. Dirty towel in bathroom when we checked in. Room did not smell fresh. Dirty dish left on the floor in the hall across from our room, for the 3 days we were there. Male desk clerk not friendly. We asked if there was any family restaurants near the hotel and he rudely said, a pizza place down the street and the hotel restaurant. The next day we found a McDonalds on the next street and many more restaurants 2 streets over. 100% non smoking hotel but people in rooms near our room smoking marijuanna and the stink was everywhere. I have chronic asthma and 3 small children and this was not acceptable by any standards. We paid, with hotel/parking, about $550.00 canadian dollars for 2 nights. Way overpriced for what we got. We will never stay there again and we travel internationally on a regular basis so are very aware of good hotels that are out there.When I checked in, I asked for a higher floor (well the 3rd floor was the highest), but the lady at the front desk told me that she could only provide me this particular room on the second floor. (I used my AAA rate) so I guess you are restricted only on certain block of rooms. That's fine but when I got in the room, the place was smelling so badly of food perhaps from the previous guest. So the windows were wide open obviously to get rid of the smell. Needless to say, it was freezing and damp since it was still raining (it was in early June). I checked back downstairs and complained. She still hesitated to move me to another room. 
Extremely unfriendly staff. Breakfast was OK, and I heard 
a guest comment that he had been staying there for years but
that the hotel had really gone downhill in terms of standards. 
The hallways could use a bit of an uplift and should be cleaned 
I will not recommend this hotel at all.
The only good thing is that they use environmental friendly products in their bathrooms.Spacious, clean room, close to Space Needle and walking distance to waterfront restaurants. Good service, breakfast, secure parking. Pleasantly surprised and affordable for the area.We were pleasantly surprised. The closeness of the monorail was great and we had an excellent view of the space needle. The rooms were large, clean and the staff were very helpful. Would definitely recommend this hotel to someone looking for nice accommodations with a good rate.This hotel is nothing special but it is not bad either. 
The location is ideal in terms of getting to the monorail to take you downtown or the space needle. 
The rooms are clean with a great big fridge to store your beers etc in.
The lobby is inviting with free coffee.
It is in a bit of a weird area, right next to a major road.
As I say nothing special but good if you are looking for a no frills decent hotel.
PaulLocated near space needle, Seattle center and monorail. Room was adequate and service pleasant and courteous. Good b'fast available early. Good for tourists. Reasonable value for a city hotel.I was pleasantly surprised by this Best Western, which I tend to think of as a fairly budget chain. This Best Western is really an exception--fantastic view of the Space Needle from my window, spacious and exceedingly clean rooms, warm and responsive desk staff. Plus the committment to Greensuites is impressive.
It's a few blocks away from Belltown so there isn't much happening in the immediate vicinity except for construction. Seems kind of deserted at night so I don't know if I'd walk around there alone at night, but hey, it's Seattle and people drive.I almost didnt book based on a couple of the reviews but I decided to chance it and I am glad I did. The hotel is a bit dated on the exterior and the neighborhood is undergoing a bit of much needed regentrification. I never felt unsafe but I can see why those unfamilar with the urban setting may be. While there were some street people about they arent aggressive and there are enough regular folk walking around that I wouldnt hesitate to put my 72 year old mother in the neighborhood. 
 The location is excellent! Read that again, Excellent. there are hundreds of restaurants all within about a 10-15 minute walk. I absolutely LOVE walking around in a vibrant downtoan urban setting and this area makes me want to trade in my suburban ranch for a loft. I tried the Spitfire on 4th and Bell and the Frontier room on 1st and Blanchard. Spitfire is southwest spicy sandwiches and salads and Frontier is excellent BBQ, not KC but very good smoked meats, ribs and sandwiches. The Space needle is around the corner, get an even numbered room for a view, otheriwise the view is just cityscape.
 The room was clean and while a bit bland served it purpose well. The bed was comfy and there was a fridge and micro. The bathroom is on the smallish side but the water pressure was great. The room is completely 'green' with low impact features which I would expect in Seattle. 
 The staff was very friendly, that famous northwest hospitality very evident. I would skip the restaurant in the lobby as it seems to be very basic hotel fare and since there are literally hundreds of great options so very close. 
 The hotel charges $15 a night for parking and while that is a huge pet peeve of mine I was aware of it going in and it only annoyed me to the point of mentioning it here. Really, tack on $20 to the price of the room and get rid of the charge, its silly. 
 With hotel prices rising rapidly in the past couple of years, this place gives a great experience at a reasonable rate. The place I stayed last year went from $140/night to $275, so at $130, this place is a steal and if you are expecting the W this aint it. If you want a clean, convenient, friendly, reasonable place to stay, you wouldnt do much better.Rooms were nice and clean. Diner in restaurant was ok. Overall good hotel. Location is good, near space needle and not to far from downtown (near monorail)
There's a club in the neighbourhood as already mentioned before, and we also had some noise of it during one night.i booked this hotel because of the good reviews on this site, but this was a bad mistake. i cannot understand how this hotel got such good reviews. i,ve been in may hotels all around the world, but this was really one of the worst. they could not find my reservation. altought the rooms are ""clean"", the hotel is 80ies style and obviously was not renovated since then. the windows in my room were so leaky that you could hear people talking and the traffic the whole night long. another sideeffect: it got terribly cold at night. the heater - from the 80ies as well - could not really solve the problem. never again.We stayed at this hotel for the Seeds of Compassion Event in April 2008. We needed a central location for Seattle Center/UW/Qwest Field. Parking was $15 per night, reasonable for Seattle standards and as a Crown Club Member, our parking was front door center... we also got to leave our car for the day we checked out. 
First impression always is the front desk, we were met with friendly smiles and excellent service from start to finish. I spend about 40 nights a year in hotels and this was the best customer service i've experienced in years. Upon checkout we received perfect directions to the location we were headed on foot. 
The location was perfectly convenient, the room was nice sized, clean, and enjoyable. Free high speed internet was a plus. We enjoyed our view of the Space Needle and the Seattle center carousel. Especially convenient was the location going back and forth to Seattle Center, getting downtown, Pike's Place, etc. 
Hands down our new place to stay in Seattle.My Son arrived only to find that they would not rent a room to him. Just because he did not hold a credit card, even though he had permission to use his parents, and we called to verify. We were told this could only be arranged during office hours. It was now late, office hours were over, I would have thought that the manager could make the decision. But he told me NO. They had nowhere else to go. The manager suggested a grungy hotel down the road. They had cash, and our credit card and we even talked to the manager, but he told us he could not make any exceptions, as this would be discrimination. I think that it is discrimination to the teenagers, as they would not rent to them with our approval, written or verbal. I can make purchases online, but somehow I could not even place my credit card as security for the price of the room and other expenses. Some policies are too strict and some exceptions should always be allowed. I spoke to Best Western head office and they told me that all Best Westerns were individually owned and operated, therefore the policy was only with this one hotel. So why couldn't the rule be bent a little? It wasn't alot to ask for. Let the decent kids have a good place to stay, no you treat them like scum and you wonder why our kids are the way they are today. WOW !!!!!!!! So if you decide to stay here, beware of policies.My partner had a meeting in this hotel so that's why we chose it. It is right next to the Space Needle but not much more. There's a club right next to it but only 1 night we had some noise from it when it closed. We had a room overlooking the Space Needle so the view was nice, to get into downtown we rode the Monorail, the station is also next to the space needle. The room itself was big, the bathroom kind of small but served its purpose. The restaurant was ok ( one of the very few restaurants that has a Montecristo sandwich!) and room service was prompt. I'll pobably will not stay on it again but in downtown proper unless you are really crazy about the Space Needle, then it's in the perfect location. There's also a McDonald's next to it.It may not be a 5-star, but you can't beat it. Third time we've stayed and they've increased in our esteem again! This BW caters to the business crowd, but we've always stayed for leisure (usually on a weekend). For the rate, it's perfect. Clean, ""green"", and if you request & it's available: a drop-dead view of the Space Needle practically across the street. (Ask again at check-in to make sure.) A mere walk to Belltown (about 5 short blocks) where too many choices of restaurants, wine (and spirits) bars, younger folks clubs (live music, pubs, etc), jazz clubs --if weather permits, a nice hoof over to even Pike's! 
You don't get the usual BW complimentary continental breakfast buffet, but b/c rates are lower we splurge on breakfast via room service. Parking's free in lower locked parking, which has cameras so we felt cool leaving our many shopping finds from this great shopping city discretely tucked away in back of our SUV. 
Check them out, for the money they're not long for best kept secret status too much longer. Kudos to the staff and management of this property; well done!While it's true that it is not the perfect place, believe me when I say that it is actually a diamond in the rough. My boyfriend and I came to visit Seattle for the first time this year, we stayed for 4 days/3nights and since I knew we were going to be out of the hotel the majority of our days with sightseeing I decided to book a room here. Best decision I ever made!!
My pros:
- Everything is within walking distance (Space Needle is practically in your backyard, Belltown with all the restaurants, bars, and clubs is just a few blocks down the street and the Pike Place market is about a 10 minute walk away or you can hop on a bus to go deeper downtown, etc)
- Rooms are clean.
- Heater worked really well
- They have room service, and their staff of servers are pretty considerate and nice
- FREE wireless internet service and it's fast!
- Room service called us to ask if we needed new towels or anything else.
- My boyfriend bought fish at Pike's Market, which was delivered to this hotel. They were nice enough to store it in their restaurant freezer for us free of charge!
Some cons:
- You have to pay for parking
- The hallways kind of scared me upon getting off the elevator because it seemed pretty dingy (they need to do some steam cleaning or something - I would not want to walk around on bare feet!)
- The construction zone next to the hotel might worry people but seriously, we didn't hear any of that noise through the walls or anything in the morning.
- The people at the front desk can be a little nicer but that really wasn't a big deal to us.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel because of its location. You can pretty much see almost everything there is to see in Seattle (or at least the best places if not everything) if you stay here and you wouldn't even need a car!This hotel was great for a quick place to go and see sights.
Directly across the street from Space needle, downtown tram,
Science center, and the downtown mall.
Amenities:
Has nice indoor pool for the kids, secure underground parking garage, and great restaurant.
Rooms are great size for either couples, or families.
Recommend this hotel for anyone who is visiting and would like to
stay downtown near sights.My wife and I took a quick 2 night trip to Seattle and were happy with the Best Western Executive Inn. First we decided to save some money and not stay directly downtown, but in Seattle Center. The Exec. Inn was next to Seattle Center, literally in the shadow of the Space Needle and the monorail. We had obviously made the right choice! The $4 roundtrip on the monorail takes you right downtown, within walking distance of every attraction and into the heart of the ""Free Bus"" zone. This hotel is a block from the Space Needle and Monorail.
The hotel itself looks like it was built in 1962 with the Space Needle but has been renovated quite nicely on the inside. The lobby and public areas are very clean and comfortable and feature free coffee, cookies and fruit. The room was standard Best Western, with some renovations such as: tiled bathroom floors, new carpet, and a great shower head. The room was also very clean along with the rest of the property. The beds of course were nothing to write home about.
Stay here and save some money! You'll hardly be in your room with so many things to do in Seattle. Plus the extra cash will help you with the food bills!!
Great Breakfast place is a block away called the 5 Point . . . and the Duck Tours are just a block away as well.I was happy with the fact that their wireless was free, they had good cable channels (Comedy Central), and the room was quite spacious (although I did have a handicapped room so I don't know if they're all that way). I appreciated the refrigerator that functioned as a normal refrigerator, not an overpriced minibar, so I could keep my leftover dinner in there for lunch without worrying about getting stuck with a charge for opening the minibar.
In general, the appointments were better than you'd get in a top hotel -- in a top hotel in Seattle you'd have a much smaller room, wireless would cost $20/night, and you still wouldn't get Comedy Central. 
Parking was expensive -- $15/night -- but you can park on the street for free with no problem. 
I had one major qualm with this motel, and that was that my ""non-smoking"" room was by no means truly smoke-free. You can't take a room that has been smoked in for 30 years, spray it with some sort of chemical that's supposed to neutralize the air, plop a ""no smoking"" sign down on the dresser, and call it a ""non-smoking"" room. After 5 minutes in the room, it was clear that it had been smoked in for years, and within an hour, my throat was raw and my eyes were burning from the residual smoke and chemicals. And I'm not all that sensitive to smoke, having grown up with a parent who was a smoker. 
The smoking issue is too bad -- because otherwise this motel is a good value for the price.We loved this hotel! Room was spacious and clean with a super comfortable bed. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Monorail is only a block away (right beside the Space Needle). A round trip ticket is only $4 and besides just being plain cool, it takes you directly to the downtown shopping district, so if you want you can leave your car at the hotel for the day. Fantastic Mexican restaurant, Azteca, about a 5-minute drive away. Excellent breakfast at the 5 Point Cafe just a couple blocks away... best pancakes I've ever eaten! We had a striking view of the Space Needle right outside our window, which was pretty neat. If you're in Seattle to tour, they also have a huge selection of tourist brochures for various activities in their lobby, which is very handy. 
All in all, we had an excellent experience here, and will definitely be staying here again on our next visit to Seattle!Located very close to Space Needle, this hotel is a good value. Our room with two queen beds was very clean, although carpet was somewhat
worn. Beds and pillows were good, but linens on the bed were lower quality than I like. Good shower and towels. Small view of downtown.
A little far out of the downtown area to walk, and free downtown shuttle bus didn't begin until 9 a.m. We had a very quiet night -no noises inside hotel or outside.Well it looks nice & modern from the outside. The front desk staff weren't particularly friendly. The corridors were dark and smelt of steam cleaned carpet (which maybe was a good thing!).
The hotel is right under the Space Needle which was thrilling when we first pulled up, and only a few mins walk away. Unfortunately we had a room at the rear, so our view was of buildings and a parking lot. Even # rooms had the Space Needle view.
There was no hotel laundry which was suprising for a larger hotel.
Hotel restaurant made mistakes with our menu & ordering - new guy I think - and numerous items were left off our tray with the room service breakfast. After a phone call, they were promptly delivered though.I was pleasantly surprised by the BW Exec. Inn. No it isn't fancy. However, the rooms are clean, good-sized and the hotel staff is excellent. It is also a self-contained hotel with restaurant and bar, small business center and hot-tub and workout room. You really don't need more. It reminded me of ""4-star"" hotels that I have stayed in in Europe. It's all there, if not up to the most modern standards.
The rooms are a bit dated. They remind me of hotels in the 80s with the floral print spread and the honey oak furniture. Comfortable bed and those funky shampoo dispensers stuck to the shower wall. (They call it ""environmentally friendly"")
The halls were dark and low-ceilinged. They could use a good carpet cleaning and lightening up. 
They have started charging for parking, which is a real bummer. Free parking would make it THE deal downtown. 
Location is great for some things, particularly the Seattle Center area. There is, however, a disco across the street (a little loud on Saturday night) and power sub-station at one end of the building.
Overall, not the Ritz, but perfectly acceptable.We truly enjoyed this hotel. It was clean and the staff was very helpful. The location was great. It is a bit of a walk to Pike's Place but it is very close to the Space Needle. I would stay here again for sure!We stayed here for one night after our cruise so we could see Seattle. We arrived at 9am, so naturally our room wasn't ready, but they stored our luggage while we left to tour the city. Upon returning we went to the room and it was a nice, large room(after being in a small stateroom for a week it seemed huge!) with 2 queen beds. It also had a microwave and fridge. This would be a good place to stay before a cruise because I noticed they had shuttles to the piers in the morning. We ate in the restaurant and it was very good and the people were very friendly. I highly recommend this hotel!Our family checked in for two nights after a terrible stay in another hotel. Checking in was quick and easy, the staff was very nice and professional. We called the morning of our check in to see if we could check in early, we wanted get out of our crappy hotel from the night before as soon as possible and they said no problem. The lobby was very comfortable and they offer coffee in the morning and fruit and cookies during the day.
The room was clean and it felt clean, if you know what I mean. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels. We didn't have a view of the space needle, we were on the other side and had a view of the hills, which was still plesant. They had a coffee maker with real coffee, a blow dryer, ironing board and cable TV. Local calls were free, which is very helpful when making reservations or just getting directions. 
I read in another review that the shuttle was a bust. But we had no problem with the shuttle, Actually it was a life saver. After walking all over seattle we really needed a ride. We called the shuttle and she was down and ready to go before we even got downstairs. The driver was great, we forgot something in our other hotel and she drove us over to pick it up. She nice and knowledgable of the area. We used the shuttle to drop us off at pike st. and called to be picked up at pioneer sq and she was there quick even durring rush hour. I highly recommend trying the shuttle.
I did use the hottub and both times I went down it was empty and very peaceful. They also offer internet access on two computers in a somewhat private room, which was great to look up attraction pricing and hours. 
The location wasn't so bad overall. It was perfect for the space needle and all the attractions around it, it was only one parking lot away. It was a little farther away from the city center, but still a pleasant walking distance away. 
We had no issue on safety, we walked to a resturant in the Queen Anne neighborhood and back around 11pm and there were still familys, teenagers, and tourist of all kinds still out having fun. I walked back with my small child around 10pm from downtown and felt completely secure as well.
Overall..we had a great vacation and our stay here was an added bonus.The rooms are clean and the view of the Space Needle is nice but don't plan on getting any sleep if you stay here. There is an unmarked night club across the street from the hotel which has a problem with their clientele not leaving quietly at 2:00 am in the morning. We woke to a very noisy and rambunctious crowd of about 100+ people this last Saturday night. We thought there was a riot going on. Don't worry though, there are plenty of security guards in the streets with batons trying to ""manage"" the crowd. When reporting this to the hotel staff, they said that's normal on Friday & Saturday nights and is usually quiet on Sunday nights. Oh, the police showed up too, announcing their arrival with their sirenes. 
We definitely won't stay here ever again.Average hotel in a good location. The outstide of the hotel looks rundown, but the inside is nice. Literally across the street from the monorail terminal, Space Needle, and EMP. When booked, was under the impression that parking was free, it's actually $5/day...not bad, but thought it was free. They boast a free shuttle to downtown, but it doesn't begin running for the day until 12 noon. The spa was also something that we looked forward to, but it was broken for our entire stay. Overall, good deal.Hotel is in great location right across street from Exp. Music Project and Space needle (which makes it easy to keep your bearings if you get lost in Seattle). On site restaurant has decent food and prices and hotel has on site free parking for guest accessible only with password or room card. No freebie continental breakfast, and a funky smell in hallway (some kind of pine? deoderizer) Room was reasonably clean, matresses firm (I like soft) but sleepable. All in all if you want just a place to sleep, close to attractions it's okay. Just a few blocks walk to ""free Ride"" area of bus service to all of the major downtown areasRecently spent 3 nights at the Best Western Executive Inn. 
Average hotel located next to the Space Needle. Room was just ""ok"", king size bed was comfy. Furniture appeared used and dated. Fridge and microwave were a nice addition. Obvious the hotel is very environmental. As far as food, other than the hotel, the foodcourt at the Seattle Center is a short walk and has a nice variety and there is a McDonalds and Starbucks a block or two away. Other than that, didn't see any other choices nearby nor any nightlife. Hotel offers a free shuttle service downtown but with long waits. Front desk will call for a cab or towncar which are plentiful but can be expensive. Taxi to the airport is $40. Would reccommend more for tourists than business travelers given the location.We chose the Executive Inn for the location to the Space Needle and Seattle Center. Our room was clean, comfortable, with a view of the Space Needle & Seattle Center, for the 4 of us (2 adults & 2 teens). It came with a combo microwave & fridge and coffee maker. If you are a light sleeper, make sure your room is away from the Brella's Rest & Lounge. There was comp. paper & am coffee & apples at the front desk & pm-cookies. Nice to access free Net. Mcdonald's is a block away and Zeek's Pizza (& Bar)2 blocks away-great value. However there was a lack of family oriented rest. close by within walking dist. (ie Denny's). Brella's menu in the hotel seemed expensive. The Continental breakfast Saturday morning was ok. It had hot oatmeal, toast, fresh fruit etc.. The monorail will be out of service for awhile. We drove to Pike Market and downtown since the shuttle bus wasn't reliable according to a posting we had read earlier.I stayed here two nights. No problems to speak of. Typical budget hotel decor and furnishings. Great location, a block from Seattle Center (the space needle, music experience, and more). A shuttle is available to take you downtown (a little over a mile, Pike Place market, shopping district, etc).
Clean, but not immaculate. I had a view of the space needle, but my window was patched with duct tape.
The elevators are about the slowest I've ever ridden. Pretty annoying.
Environmental hotel: fluorescent lights, recycling bins, placards requesting you keep your sheets and towels for the duration of your stay (you can decline if you choose), soap/shampoo dispensers to save packaging. This kind of thinking needs to spread.
Some personnel were quite helpful, and others not so much. The second person I asked referred me to Zeek's for lunch. Two blocks away, I got a good salad and good pizza and a drink for $7 for lunch. Very nice.I stayed at the Best Western Executive because a group I belong to was using it for a weekend conference. I have read the other comments and have to agree with may things I read here. The lack of sound proofing is evident as I could hear the maids vacuuming the adjacent rooms. However I did not hear any of my neighbors - they were either quiet or the rooms were empty. I was on the 5th floor pretty far down the hall away from the elevator and they told me that this would be a quiet area which it proved to be. Another person in my group had the room from hell - evidently their neighbors were partying all night loudly and when the front desk was called the party would die down only long enough to pass inspection and them booted up as soon as the management left. 
I overheard comments about the restaurant food being overpriced, but I did not eat there. I did notice that the bar was closed up and deserted by 11 pm on a Saturday night despite the fact that our group was still using the adjacent room and many people wanted to wander over to the bar for a drink. The hotel is non-smoking except for a small area in the bar - this is a big plus for me. The location is extremely good if you are planning to go to the Seattle Center. They do accept pets - and welcomed my dog who was certainly pushing their 50lb limit - but they did charge a hefty one time $35.00 pet fee. I don't mind some kind of pet fee - but this seems a little high. 
While they have security measures in the garage at night - you have to use your room key to enter the gate - it is still a deserted garage and I don't think I would want to be caught down there waiting for the extremely slow elevator if someone snuck in behind me before the outside automatic gate closed. (During the day the gate was open all the time.) The neighborhood is industrial and there are some strange characters wandering around at night. For the most part if felt safe - if you paid attention while you walked around. I don't know about the shuttle - but I heard that a lot of people were waiting for it so you don't want to be in a rush when you use it. The room itself was clean and comfortable. Big pluses are the refrigerator (dorm room size with no mini-bar items using up the space) and the microwave as well as the WIFI connection. But be warned if you plan to leave your computer in your room - a member of our group was robbed of a couple thousand dollars worth of electronic gadgets when the thief slipped in when the maid was cleaning the room, acting as though they were the registered guest. There is a computer in their business office that you can use. 
The comments about the different attitudes of the staff was very true - some people were enthusiastic and helpful while others just wanted to quote me the corporate bible rules that supported them denying me an adjustment for the ridiculous pet fee. My rate was probably not the lowest rate as others have reported getting a better rate via expedia or price line. If you can get a bargain rate, and request a quiet room, this becomes an even greater value. It is easy in the daytime to walk everywhere if you like walking, and Seattle is a great town to see by foot. The parking for our group was free, and apparently it is free for all guests based on the other comments I have seen here, but you might want to check with the hotel.
I did notice that they were using one outlet with an multi-plug adapter and did inform the management that a fire inspector would probably frown on this as a fire hazard. I would hope that they corrected this.I was disappointed with the Best Western Executive Inn. Was hoping for a bit more modern and more luxurious hotel. Rooms clean but old fashioned. Free complimentary downtown shuttle service had 45min waiting time when we wanted it. Would not stay there again.I stayed at the Best Western Executive Inn for three nights. For my trip, the location was PERFECT. It was a four minute walk to Seattle Center so seeing the Experience Music Project/Sci Fi Museum and Space Needle and the monorail etc was so easy. The hotel is along several regular bus routes and near different restaurants and eateries. Walking to the Queen Anne neighborhood was no problem. In terms of the hotel itself--the staff was friendly. I had a double queen room and it was clean and well-furnished with a fridge and microwave that came in handy. There was also free wireless access throughout the hotel--a big plus! A previous reviewer mentioned the room smelled and they did not have 24 hour room service--this was not true. I think that reviewer was confused--there is a Best Western Loyal Inn a few blocks over (and it did not look as appealing as the Best Western Executive Inn). If I'm in Seattle again, I'm definitely going to book at the Best Western Executive Inn.Our room was clean and comfortable, the location was very convenient to Seattle Center, there was free on-site parking, and the staff were generally very friendly and helpful. If one likes to walk, there are many restaurants to choose from, but not next door. 
The next time I am in Seattle, this will be my first choice. My only suggestions are that one not rely on the shuttle service. While they do their best to accommodate people, they can't always be available at the time people would like. It might be useful if they set up a reservation system so one would know whether or not the mini bus would be available when needed. Also I did miss the continental breakfast which many other Best Westerns provide, although there was tea and coffee, as well as apples and cookies if you were in the lobby early enough.Booked this hotel through Travelocity because it was close to the Space Needle and had a restaurant. The restaurant should be avoided at all costs - food is overpriced and despite my waitress's best intentions, almost inedible. First night there we ate dinner. I ordered Steak and Shrimp for almost $19 only to receive a dry over cooked tiny piece of meat and two shrimp. Tried getting roomservice the next day for breakfast, was informed they do not serve room service on weekends! Room was clean but was non-smoking and smelled like cigarettes. Wouldn't stay there again.Conveniently located close to the Seattle Center, the Space Needle, the EMP and the Northern surroundings of Seattle, this is a very nice hotel. We enjoyed during two different stays in July 05 a fine service. Rooms are large, Wi-Fi is available for free in every room, secured and closed parking, etc. Quiet location. 
On top of that, we appreciated the quality of the food in the restaurant. We recommend more specially the “Belgian waffles” for the breakfast… We know what we are talking about: we are from Belgium! 
All in all: an excellent choice for Seattle.This year on our vacation we stayed at 3 different BW locations. We were pleased with all of them. At the Executive we booked an upgraded room and were satisfied with everything even if it was a little expensive. The room had a couch, chair & footstool, fridge, microwave, king size bed and a few touches that made it a little more luxurious than average. We had a great view of the Space Needle and we took the monorail down to Pike Place Market and walked around the waterfront and Pioneer Square. Glad we didn't have to drive in Seattle as that alone could have ruined our visit. This hotel was cheaper than one on the waterfront or right in the downtown business district and the monorail or the free zone for the bus make getting around easy. We actually like to walk so did that except for the mono back and forth from the Space Needle. The front desk gave us directions to the ferry for our trip to the Olympic Penisula and were in general courteous and helpful. All in all we'd stay here again if we ever return to Seattle.I have not stayed at Best Westerns in years, but maybe I should start if this hotel is any indication:
1. good, clean , quiet, confortable and clean rooms
2. good size rooms
3. decent exercise room and indoor hot tub
4. good price 
5. excellent location
6. free parking which definitely played into our decision to book ( we had 6 rooms for 12 guests)
7. free shuttle service which we used serveral times - to baseball game, downtown drops, etc. Wonderful.
8. all the front desk staff were friendly and went above the norm to help us out with any questions. I think a young staff has more energy and Best Western must be training properly. I think I was greeted almost every time we came in, day or night. This should be the standard for any hotel; the staff actually made you feel like a wanted client rather than another annoying tourist. Thanks.We wanted something cheap near the Space Needle. I was expecting a tired, worn out property but it was well cared for, the rooms are nicely decorated. The neighborhood is so-so. Two blocks to the Space Needle. For pizza and salad head to Zeeks.Stayed here w/ my husband, mother and small dog. Pet friendly was a huge plus for us. Front desk staff was great. Location is amazing! We had a view of the Space Needle out our window. Room was spacious. Free parking. Used hot tub and fitness room, both were great. Office center which allows free computer and internet use was a great bonus as I did not have my laptop with me. Only poss neg is that the free shuttle seems a bit disorganized and was overbooked for our trip to the Mariner's game. I would definitely go back.I was expecting the worst and received the best. This Hotel is located just two blocks from the Pacific Science Center and the Space Needle. If you are looking to do downtown Seattle as a tourist you cannot do much better, in my opinion, than the Best Western Executive Inn. I utilized Expedia and got a double queen for 65.00 a night. In my opinion it was a great deal. I and my daughter cannot think of one negative experience. Secure parking was a nice plus. Front desk staff was exceptional. Breakfast was great. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Bottom line.....Great value in Downtown Seattle and I would stay there again and again.We just returned from vacationing in Seattle and stayed at the Best Western Executive Inn. I got an excellent rate on Priceline (I didn't know how excellent until the front desk personnel refused to state my rate out loud.) This hotel is in an excellent location and the free parking is a plus. However, the rooms do need updated, the soundproofing is not adequate and the customer service is not the best. Some of the personnel were most helpful and went out of their way to be of service; others acted as if they could care less. The free shuttle service they are so quick to advertise is extremely unreliable and our driver apparently was not from Seattle, as he drove with a map on his lap, generally in all the wrong directions. We were stranded one evening all alone on the waterfront; the shuttle driver indicated that he was very busy and said we should take a cab. Did I have the phone number of the cab company? No, I did not. The restaurant personnel were also undertrained. Overall, I felt the hotel and restaurant were not well managed. If you know what you're getting into, however, the place was fine.We stayed here for our 10 YR anniversary. The people were very nice and even allowed us to trade rooms so on our last night we could be on the Space Needle side. The free & secure parking was great. Most of all we loved the location. We took the monorail a few times. We also walked down to the waterfront and caught the little train that runs all the way to Pioneer Square. Would stay there again!I have stayed at this hotel for years. Lately, the front desk has been unhelpful and rude. Everytime I try to make a reservation, the phone is answered at the 20th or so ring. I once called downstairs to ask why room service wasn't answering their line and the front desk said ""What do you want me to do?"" Like, duh! Get me room service! When you make a reservation, the front desk always gives you a lower rate than the national line they connect you to. Once I was going to change rooms b/c the heater took a long time to come on but eventually did. But the next day when I returned from ameeting, I found my stuff to be packed and some stuff was removed. They had made a mistake and showed that I checked out. I like the rates of the hotel and the parking. The view is nice also but the interior needs to be updated. It feels too 70's.Ahhh, what can we say about this hotel. We were staying here on a deal from a timeshare company, so I guess we shouldn't complain too loudly BUT since when did we want to subscribe to 24 hour broadcasting of other guests' lives? We could hear everything from the rooms on either side of us and could understand their conversations. We had a mother and kids on one side, laughing up a storm and music videos followed by business telephone conversations on the other. we're sure they could hear us too, which leaves something to be desired, we're sure. They have a great location, but need to invest in some soundproofing before we would stay there again. The restaurant had good food, but was understaffed. Other than the soundproofing issue, we found them clean and comfortable. We would however, not stay here again unless it was free or close to it! Definitely not up to Best Westerns' standards.we had a ships reunion at the hotel the staff was very professional and polite, they could not do enough for us. the food was very good in the restaurant and the banquet. i would recommend this property to anyone going to seattle.Quiet is putting it mildly when refurring to where I live in the heart of the Walla Walla Valley's wine country. Coyotes, Crickets and Owls are the night sounds you hear. Winery business brings me to Seattle at least once a month to promote my winery and to do charity events. Just getting from point A to point B is..... shall I say interesting. add that to not being use to the city noise and you have the perfect recipe for insomnia! I use to stay downtown, but wasn't getting any sleep due to all the unusaul sounds. Add that to the fact that I was paying a large fee to not get any sleep and you have one crabby person. Then I was introduced to the Executive Inn, thru a room promotion given to the Walla Walla Valley Wineries thru the Washington Wine Commission. I had waited until the very last moment to make a room reservation and was sure that I wasn't going to get a room any where. But I called anyway. 
The Phone was answered by the nicest Gentleman asking how he could help me. I said with desperation ""I need a room, have you any left?"" The magic words were spoken with enthusiasm, Yes I do! I booked the room and asked for directions off the freeway. It was so easy to find that I was there before I could get lost. I was greeted by the nice voice I had heard over the phone. Michael made check-in a breeze. I asked for a nonsmoking room on the quiet side. I got A nonsmoking room with a fantastic view of the Space Needle. The room was clean and Quiet. I was amazed. I loved the fact that the parking was sucure. As a woman that is very important, it is one of the first questions that I ask any hotel I call. Oh and did I mention free! The restaurant was good, the sevice fast, efficiant, and reasonable. The true test was to come that night after a long wine event. I turned off the air, opened the window, climbed into bed and slept. I slept in Seattle!! The next morning I was out of bed at 6:am and ready for Seattle, not laying there thinking just a few more moments. The day staff was just as pleasant and efficiant as the night before. Helping me with directions, a cab, a great restaurant and a smile. I stay there every time I come to Seattle. It's close to every place I need to be. What more can you ask for. Well since I am in the wine buesiness, maybe a better wine List! 
Thanks Sally Thomason Whitman CellarsSorry to hear other folks didn't appreciate their stay at this property. I've been coming here for business off and on for 2 years and really enjoy the location and service. The improvements have been great! Seattle's Best Coffee is free in the lobby in the morning, the restaurant offers good food at a good value, and the lounge has karaoke, darts and a pool table to unwind. Even though half the building faces the Space Needle, I prefer the downtown view on the other side. Request the fifth floor at the front desk for a better view.
I've stayed at more expensive properties in Seattle and felt like I was getting ripped off. Not here. The free parking saves me at least $20 a day. Join the Best Western loyal traveller club (Gold Crown?) to get a free stay out of them worldwide.
I used to think Best Westerns sucked...but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.Just got back from our stay at this great little hotel. Location was great! Right across from the Space Needle, EMP and Momorail. We rented a car so free parking was a great plus. We loved the restaurant with a full menu and the servers were very nice. Adam at night was the best! 
Whatever we needed to know was answered by the desk people. Rachel did a great job setting up some tours for us. Rooms were very clean and new carpet throughout the place looked great. We will be back!Maybe my expectations are too high, however it seems that many chain hotels focus too much on the perks and not enough on the basics. Skip the newspaper and pay the housekeepers more so they'll vaccum under the beds. Please don't give me tiny bottles of shampoo and microscopic bars of soap until you can afford to apply a fresh coat of paint above the shower enclosure. And who cares about an in-room coffeemaker when it's 100+ degrees with a nonfunctioning air conditioning unit? I'll pass on the coffee and just suck down some ice cubes, thankyou. Bottom line is I want a clean, cool, comfortable room, and a courteous, caring staff. 
None of the aforementioned can be found at this particular hotel so I'd suggest staying elsewhere. Oh, one positive thing... the 2"" thick morning newspaper comes in handy for leveling out the bed. Good Travels!Made reservations on Travelocity and hotel would not honor the rates. Was told that Travelocity was not authorized to issue those rates. Hotel DOES NOT ACCEPT CASH! Make sure you have your creidt card. Room overlooked garbage compactor, staff threw away garbage all hours of the night. Paint peeling off walls in bathroom. Shuttle service unreliable. I suggest the monorail, taxi, or rental car. The only good things were the location to Seattle Center, the daytime shuttle driver, and the breakfast buffet. Otherwise, STAY ELSEWHERE!I stayed at the Best Western Executive Inn back in October. Great place the staff is great and the rates were great. Ask for a room on the Space Needle side. Its clean its reasonably priced and its convenient. The reservation agent Keith doesn't have the best attitude but he is just a tart apple amongst a bunch of sweet ones.Ich war 2 Nächte in diesem Hotel in Seattle. Das Personal war stets freundlich und hilfsbereit, das Zimmer geräumig und bequem. Die Lage ist ok, ca. 20 min. von Dowtown entfernt und gleich neben dem Space Needle. Das Frühstück hat mir sehr gut geschmeckt, für 8$ steht das ganze Buffet zur Verfügung. Das Zimmer ist war ziemlich frisch, deshalb musste auch ständig die Klimaanlage/Heizung eingeschaltet sein. Preisleitungsverhältnis absolut ok.Das Best Western Executive Inn liegt in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße nur einen Steinwurf von Seattle's Space Needle entfernt und bieten einen hervorragenden Ausgangspunkt für eine Stadterkundung (z.B. mit der Monorail in die Innenstadt). Von außen gesehen gleicht das Hotel einem Betonklotz ohne Charme. Doch schon in der Lobby verändert sich der Eindruck. Da unser Flieger früh in Seattle landete, hatten wir Zweifel schon am Vormittag einchecken zu können. Doch wir erhielten unser reserviertes Nicht-Raucher-Zimmer mit King-Bett (118,96 USD plus tax) ohne Probleme. Das Personal an der Rezeption war dabei sehr freundlichen und hilfsbereit. Auch das Zimmer mit neuem Mobiliar verbreitete eine wohlige Atmosphäre. Einzig der Blick aus dem Fenster nach Osten war wenig erbaulich. Das Zimmer war mit LCD-Kabel-TV, Mikrowelle, Kühlschrank, Kaffeemaschine, Föhn und kostenlosem WIFI ausgestattet. Positiv fanden wir auch den Seifen-/Conditioner-Spender im Bad. Frühstück war nicht im Übernachtungspreis eingeschlossen. Das Hotel serviert seinen Gästen aber ein warmes Frühstücksbuffet in Brella's Restaurant. Für ein mittelmäßiges Frühstück zahlten wir 17,49 USD für zwei Erwachsene. Da wir am Abreisetag keine Zeit hatten, war das Buffet die bequemste Wahl. Außerdem ist limitiertes Parken vorhanden und kostet 15,00 USD pro Nacht. Für unseren nächsten Seattle-Besuch werden wir das BW Executive Inn bestimmt wieder in die engere Wahl ziehen. Wir waren mit der Übernachtung zufrieden.Hotellet ligger hyfsat centralt med gångavstånd till centrum, ca 20 min promenad. Hotellet är av medelstandard men av traditionell amerikansk bunkertyp. Jag vill pointera, att hotell i USA oftast inte bjuder på någon intressant arkitektur, utan är funktionellt rektangulära. Rummen var rena och stora, men frukosten var påver i skandinavisk jämförelse. Frukosten var dock en av de bästa jag ätit på ett Best Western i USA. Kommunikationerna till flygplatsen var goda, då en flygbuss-shuttle gick 50m från hotellet.Das Best Western Executive Inn liegt ein wenig außerhalb von Seattle Downtown. Man braucht knapp 20 Minuten zu Fuss und man ist in der Innnenstadt.
. Wie bei allen Best Western Hotels gilt, ""Hast Du eines gesehen, hast Du alle gesehen"", man bekommt den gewohnten Standard, aber nicht mehr.
Die Zimmer sind in Ordnung und sauber, das Personal ist freundlich und bemueht.Nur ein paar Minuten zu Fuss vom Laser Dome,Imax und Space Needle entfernt.
Parkplatz im Basement des Hotels (Kostet Extra).Geräumige saubere Zimmer mit bequemen Bett.Allerdings veraltetes Dekor und nach Bildern umplazieren sieht man die Löcher der alten Aufhängungen in den Wänden.Dusche und WC durchschnittlich.
Wireless Internet im Preis inbegriffen aber klemmte ab und zu.Beim einchecken dauerte es etwas da nur ein Angestellter am Schalter.Der Eincheck-Vorgang selber war freundlich und speditiv.
Im Laser Dome laufen übrigens Top Lasershows an den Wochenenden , sollte man mindestens einmal im Leben gesehen haben !!Das Best Western war ok, es ist zweckmäßig eingerichtet und nicht mehr ganz neu. Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig und dem Standard entsprechend ausgestattet. Leider sind die Zimmer sehr hellhörig, man ist bei allen Aktivitäten im Nachbarzimmer live dabei ;-) Nett ist die Lage direkt am Space Needle. Das Personal ist relativ abgeklärt und sehr auf einen flüssigen Ablauf bedacht :-) Unser Frühstück war sehr spartanisch, aber ausreichend, um nicht hungrig in den Tag zu starten... Für einen Trip nach Seattle in einem günstigen Hotel kann ich das Best Western empfehlen.Geräumige Zimmer, etwas nüchhtern eingerichtet.
Schöne großes Duschbad.
Sehr gute zentrale Lage. Sehenswürdigkeiten können gute Fußgänger, gut zu Fuß erreichen. Hotel ist in einem sicheren Stadtteil.
Aufmerkames, freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal, gab gute Tips, organisierten 
Konzertkarten.
Anständiges Prei/Leistungsverhältnis夜10時くらいにホテルに到着しました。
スペースニードル近くに位置しますが、周りにお店などありません。
唯一、ホテルの近くにマクドナルドがあるくらいです。
初めてシアトルに来たため、土地勘もないので、夜は出歩きませんでした。
海外はどこもおんなじかもしれませんが、シャワーが固定されていて使いづらいです。
チェックイン時は、英語が全然しゃべれない私たちに対して
フロントの女性が気持ちよく対応してもらえたので、よかったです。
残念なのは、チェックアウト後、荷物を預かってもらっていたのですが、
荷物がないと、ホテルの人が騒ぎはじめ、焦りました。
結局は、荷物が移動されていたため、ホテルの人が勘違いしていただけのようでした。
ほとんど、観光で寝るためだけのホテルとしてはまあまあです。
今度は、ダウンタウン中心部のホテルに泊まりたいです。Wir buchten 2 Nächte mit Space-Needle View. Das Zimmer war geräumig, allerdings auch etwas teurer, aber der Ausblick (wir wohnten im 5.Stock) zu jeder Tages- und Nachtzeit wunderbar. Die Umgebung ist relativ ruhig. Parken kostet extra $ 15,-.
Man ist auch zu Fuß sehr schnell im Zentrum. Monorail nur 5 min. entfernt. 10 min zum Wasser und in der Umgebung gibt es einige nette Restaurants.
Der Frühstückraum (das Frühstück ist ganz gut) wird abends zum Restaurant umfunktioniert. Das Essen ist einfach scheußlich (bloß kein Menu essen!), die Bedienung (eine ältere, überforderte Dame) nervig. Lieber außer Haus essen gehen.Hotel is in a great spot with a view of the space needle from our window, walking distance to everywhere. Room was huge and fine. Free breakfast was great, heaps of food - hot and cold.
We are budget travellers, a step above hostels, as we want to get the most out of the day/night and only need somewhere clean to lay our head. I wouldn't want to stay here for a romantic getaway, but we were thrilled with the price and what we got for it.We had to cancel our trip at the last minute due to some extenuating circumstances (wishing Elton John a speedy recovery)...however we had booked our stay using an online service whose powers of negotiation apparently do not include changing or canceling your reservation. After speaking to the staff at the Best Western and explaining the situation, they agreed to help us try to get a cancellation and a refund. After quite a bit of back and forth with the online service, they agreed to give us a refund based on the hotel's willingness to accept the circumstances. They really didn't need to help us at all, and yet they went out of their way and even followed up with us to make sure they had provided everything we needed. We will definitely stay here when we eventually make it up to Seattle.Disgusting! Yowza. Super friendly front person dude. Walked into room--with the window open, fans going and the overwhelming powerfully disturbing smell of flea powder. When we went downstairs to see what was up, the female front desk person immediately said, ""Oh, Room XXX?"" Note--we never said the room, just described the scene. It was like a murder happened and they were trying to keep it a secret--including from the cool front desk dude, because he said, ""You need to tell me about those kind of things!"" We were totally freaked out. Even though the cool dude said they were at occupancy, he sure found us another room pronto and seemed there were more to spare. The next room was better, but still gross. I won't go there again. Several pluses--was cheap compared to everything else (you get what you pay for); the floors were pretty clean and there was a cool mirror that supersized your face. I stared at my pores for countless minutes. Great continental breakfast--real OJ. Enjoyable hot tub.I stayed their over the labor day week end. The manager was rude and he even repermended his employee in front of the guest (me).The room was very spacious but dated the carpet was old and streched out. You could see the lumps in the carpet and the furniture top of tables where starting to bubble because it was laminated wood top. The best part is that you are in walking distance to the seattle center where we hung out most of the day. and still close to downtown. But I think for the money we spent we could of got a much nicer hotel. They just need to do a renovation they have not done anything to the hotel for at least 10 years.My wife and I are from the UK and stayed in Seattle for a week to attend Seattle Opera's Wagner Ring Cycle.
The Best Western Executive Inn is one of the nearest hotels to McCaw Hall (Seattle Opera's home) and underneath the shadow of the Space Needle. The monorail to the shops was nearby too.
The hotel suited us fine - we liked the self-made waffle machine at breakfast.I have always stayed in Best Western before and never in my life thought that I would be writing this review. But this experience left a bad, bad taste. When I got my room booked for two queen beds because my wife is pregnent, I got one bed. When talking to the front desk, he mentioned that something was wrong with my booking. Anyways, they did offer to reduce the price. I was not even looking for the reduced price. I need rest and comfort, otherwise why I am spending so much money. Anyways, they also offered a rollaway bed - the most uncomfortable bed. I could not sleep whole night. I extended my stay, thinking that the previous night was one time deal. But it was a mistake. Since I could have good sleep, I took prescribed sleep aid. The next day, when I asked for late checkout @ 1 PM, they blatantly deny the request. They gave one hour, which was not sufficient for my sleep and my pregnant wife was also not well. And I had to drive for 6 hrs. Anyways, we left at noon. While driving on freeway, I avoided a serious accident because I was sedated and giddy. Only if I could have taken more rest, I would have never witnessed that incident. Then we went to rest area and took a lot rest. After coming from the trip, I did file the complaint. The first step to fix the problem is to recognize the problem - the problem that they had in your system instead of blaming me with my booking or having some sympathy to ask why we want to extend by an hour. They became defensive. I am sure they are going to put a comment to explain how every customer is important and how it was not there mistake. Apart from the misleading parking lot charge that I was not aware about ( and someone else had the same problem here) and dull ambience, the inability to recognize the problem in their service is a big disapppointment. Well, I made it clear to them that they are not getting any service from me or from my customers or vendors. Please use your judgement inspite of the response from the management to this comment. Why so many people are not happy is very clear to me. Stop being defensive and start fixing the problem with your service.I'm writing this for my parents who are not computer savvy and because I made the reservations for them and interacted most with the staff over the phone. It was nothing but a pleasure working with them in making my parents stay the best possible. Now as for my parents feed back: They were stunned at the view from their room, the size, cleanliness and beauty of everything from the bedroom to the bathroom. They were smiling from ear to ear. They had a dietetic restriction that I needed help with. The executive chef happily assisted me in making sure my parents had everything they needed. The staff was truly one in a million in making sure their hotels name would remain great. I cant wait to one day take a trip out there and experience the same for myself!We stayed for 1 night and I'm glad it wasn't longer. We had a non-smoking room but the floor we were on smelled of stale cigarette smoke. Our room had a nice view of the space needle but it did not seem clean to me. The carpet seemed worn and in need of a good cleaning. the pillows were horrible. They were the smallest, pathetic excuse for pillows I have ever seen. They were so small I had considered using towels (except we didn't have enough to even shower) or our own clothing as pillows... SMALL PILLOWS!!!!!! The free breakfast was OK. The worst part about it was that no one waits their turn in line, but that says more about society today than the hotel. They knew there were 4 people in our room yet we had 2 towels and 2 wash cloths and good luck getting more. We stayed there because we were returning from Whistler and wanted to have dinner at the Space Needle before we flew back the next morning. It was convenient to the Space Needle but I would definitely check out some other chains in the area. They have to be better than this place.You can see the Space needle right from your room window... Walking distance from fast food restaurant, train, space needle and other attractions or just take a train for a few dollars to downtown (8-10 min.). Hotel personnel were very helpful and polite... Get very busy with people cruising out of Seattle... Morning breadfast was included on hotel rate...I specifically chose this hotel due to the location to the space needle, yet thought it would be wonderful to have a view of the needle from our room. Unfortunately by the time we arrived from the airport, none of those rooms were available. The room was fine, but had no view, and the sound of sirens kept us awoke us during the night. 
It was just myself and my 16yo daughter, and we felt quite nervous walking in the neighborhood after dark. The free breakfast was just ok (possibly at the end of the morning shift), but it was free. Parking was $15."
